I now get between 24-36 hours between charges. Bottom line, if you consistently need to recharge and you don't always have access to power, get this battery.I don't know if I am a heavy or light user. Let me tell you how I use my Droid and you can compare my experience/usage with yours.My Droid is rooted and I am running CyanogenMod 6.1.2 with an overclocked 1100 Mhz kernel. I use set-CPU to keep the clock between 550 Mhz and 1100 Mhz with setpoints based on temperature to drop the speed to 300Mhz. I don't use any task killers at all (they are worse than useless, but that is a different story). I primarily use Wi-Fi for data.During the day, I use my Droid for data operations like Twitter (5 minute updates), video watching (maybe 5-10 minutes, sometimes longer), listening to music (a few hours), getting email using GMail (push) and Exchange using Touchdown (which is power hungry when using push), running the GPS and other activities like games. On a recent trip, I left my laptop at home and brought a Bluetooth keyboard with me. Even using that for hours at a time, I still had more than enough battery power to get me through the day.My normal usage would suck the stock battery dry in 6-8 hours. I ended up disabling a number of features to eke out maybe 8 hours of life from the stock Droid battery. I used to carry a spare battery with me, but that didn't help much plus I had to shutdown and swap the battery which is not terribly convenient. With the Seidio, I now get close to 36 hours or more.I did what others who have reviewed the battery did. I charged the battery for 10+ hours, ran it down to less than 5% (did a reboot to verify), and charged it back up another 10 hours. Works fine.The battery is a bit bulky but the cover fits snugly into the Droid body. I don't use a holster or cover, so I didn't have a problem with accessories. I did find that the batter pack did alter my use of both the hard and soft keyboard. It put me out of position just enough that it took some time to get my hands back in place.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Two to four times more battery life", "unixReviewTime": 1299974400, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2011"}

Very high quality, but also adds a lot of mass and bulk. And since rubber is non-slip, it can be a pain to retrieve out of your pockets while in certain positions (ahem, like while driving).So this Commuter version is a better alternative (I don't think they have a High Impact version for the N900 yet).This version is made of high quality plastic, which a thin inner rubber lining on the bottom side (opposite of the screen side), to protect the phone from short falls and small knocks.It fits into the phone very nicely and securely - very little creaks and give from loose spaces.In fact, you will find it very hard to pop it out when you have to replace a SIM card or battery (but there is a trick to get it to open easily, which is hard to describe, so you'll have to find it on your own).It doesn't add much bulk to the phone, and ultimately, gives you a great peace of mind, which is what it's all about.The only small negative about it (like any other case for phones with big screens), is that there is no way it can protect the screen side from falls onto bumpy or angled surfaces.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Peace of Mind", "unixReviewTime": 1281312000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2010"}

I must say the armor case is the better one. The exterior is metal and the interior has soft layer to protect the N900 from scratches. The armor case is solidly built, high quality. The case protects all areas. What I like the most about the case is that it's ONE piece. As you know the N900 is a slider phone so most cases has to be consisted of two pieces, one for the screen and one for the bottom. The armor case is designed in such a fashion that is a single piece. If you need to access the keyboard, you would flip the case open instead of sliding.Otter box case for N900 in my opinion is the second best case after the armored one. As many reviewers have stated already, it is pretty sturdy, high quality plastic case. If you're like me who loves their N900, would go for the most protective case, which would be the armored one.

The charger is small and doesn't take up a lot of wall space, and has a blue indicator light, indicating power flow. The charger does work charging up to 4 devices, HOWEVER, it only does so on a limited flow of power, and doesn't even charge my iPad 2. The amount of electricity used is similar to that of a non-powered USB port on your computer. For example, the USB ports on a standard Apple USB keyboard do not power devices; this charger uses the same kind of ports. Even plugging in one device at a time does not charge at full capacity. When I plug in my iPad 2 via its dock connector cable, my iPad displays \"Not Charging\" next to the battery indicator; worthless! When I plug in my Samsung Nexus S 4G via its USB charge cable, it takes twice the usual time to charge to full capacity. I did not notice any significant difference in charging my Kindle or iPod Shuffle than with their factory chargers.Overall, this USB charger is an awesome idea, but it fails to live to its expectations. I really wish I did not have to return this item, I really would like to consolidate having so many USB chargers for different devices.

We sat there at the kitchen table working all the pieces and just marveling at how they thought of all the little things that make a difference and make something work. I have read that there are challenges with suction sticking on some car mounts. We haven't had any problems with that. The suction is awesome. For those with that issue you may want to wet the suction part slightly with water before applying.

Geha", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "GeneralThe one I received looks a little different from the one pictured but it's pretty close.  For the price, I can't complain, as it appears to be made rather well with some nice features and blends well with my car's black interior.  I have searched for a while and found nothing at any price that would work for me.  This one works just fine.InstallationIt took a couple of tries and some moistening of the suction pad before I got it to stick to my car windshield but it is holding so far.  Temperatures here vary from the teens in the winter and 80s+ in summer, so I fully expected it to fall off at some point....but thankfully it has been holding on for months.  I use it twice a day, every day minimum.  I never remove it from the window....my husband just cleans around it.FeaturesThe long extension from the base can be bent & shaped in order to position the unit within reach.  I chose to make these adjustments before I locked on the unit bracket.  I was able to  position my Evo above the dash to the right of the steering wheel without it getting in the way of anything, including my view of the road.  I opted for this type of bracket as I did not care to use other types which looked very bulky/unsightly and could scratch/damage my interior in some way.  I have the unit in the lower center of my windshield and bent down slightly but not touching the dash.  I have the little feet extended out to hold the bottom of the phone and only need to use one hand to place my phone in the holder as I gently compress the cushioned side arms inward to secure the phone in place. I have used a couple of different cases and it holds solidly with case on.FunctionalityIf my phone is not in the holder, the unit is very stable and makes no noise, unlike reviews from others who purchased similar units.  When my phone is in the holder while driving, however, the weight of the phone seems to cause the unit to wobble a bit, but it's not terrible.  It does not make noise though, just goes from a slight vibration to a mild wobble.  (That's why I only gave it 4 stars.)  Since I never interact with my phone while driving anyway, it doesn't matter to me as long as my phone is in view and secure.  If I need to do something on the phone, I do it when stopped.  I have factory bluetooth in my car so I can now use more of the phone's features totally hands free and can easily see what's going on. I love that.  I have used my phone's navigation while it is mounted and can display it both in portrait and landscape positions, as the bracket rotates nicely clicking to those positions and more if desired.  Most of the time I use it in the portrait position.  I would say that it is made reasonably well and it is likely to last a while if used with gentle care.  It is mostly plastic, so rough handling/abuse may take its toll on the unit.  It has a small button on the back near the top which when gently pressed causes the padded bracket arms to release the phone into my hand for quick disconnect.Bottom line.....I like it very much.  It holds my Evo safely, looks nice and does the trick.  Time will tell whether or not it holds up to regular use, but I hope so, as I'm enjoying the convenience it provides.  I may even order another one as a backup just in case.Also, I would like to thank this and other sellers for making desirable accessories available at very affordable prices.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice window mount for my HTC Evo", "unixReviewTime": 1300924800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2011"}

Was concerned a little about how it fit when I first got it.  Does not fit tight to head like a sunglass's band that it resembles.  However, found this to be fine in terms of comfort and great in terms of not having to clean it from sweaty workouts.  The in-ear parts don't go too far in for me, which allows me to wear them while laying down with head on pillow.  Actually improves the bass a bit more.  I've been able to wear for hours without issue.Sound quality is much better than I expected.  I use a Nokia XpressMusic 5800 and after adjusting the bass to maximum, it really has pretty good quality for a bluetooth.  Plus it's fine for taking calls.  But don't expect to hear anything else as the in-ear fit seals off most outside noise.  I really don't use for phone calls unless I just happen to get one while wearing.  Don't get caught wearing these in a car as most states consider it illegal to wear full head phones that impair hearing, while you drive.Battery time is really great!  You can go several days without really having to charge it.  Your phone will die much quicker than this headset when playing music.  And the AC chargers for Nokia phones works with it.  Just can't listen while charging.Thought it might look a little too Star-Wars-ish, but not as bad as it looks.Simple setup (for phone) and buttons are great.  Volume and forward/back song selection rocker switches are a nice touch.  Hard to accidently change, easy enough when you need to.  Do have to press the answer and pause buttons a little hard to click on/off which tends to push the in-ear bud a little deeper that can cause discomfort.  Setup for PC not easy and I still don't have the sound quality set right.  I really did not get it for the PC, but proper setup is an issue for those who are needing it for such.

They started to get static and weak signals last week (I think due to the humidity in New Orleans, never had that problem in colorado's arid climate), and then i bumped them just wrong and the left side snapped clean off, left hanging by the wires.While they lasted, they were great for listening to tunes~ nice on the bus, could just leave the iPod, Tablet, phone or whatever other device I was using in my backpack, and control everything without having to keep devices handy. For this use, I much preferred this pair of headphones most of my others. They are/were also much more comfortable than the pair from Motorola that I have.I'd definitely recommend these, but with warning:First, the weak spots just above the control buttons, where they are the skinniest, and also where the most force is put while putting them on/taking them off. This is where mine snapped, and there isn't really a way to fix this~ I've tried super glue, epoxy, tape, splint... Nothing decent has come yet.Second, these are really only good for listening, not for use as a phone headset. If you are looking for a stereo headset for two-way use, I'd recommend looking for something with a boom mic. This style of headset picks up every sound in the room except for your voice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for music, not the best for phone calls", "unixReviewTime": 1317254400, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2011"}

I choose it to help hold me over until the iPhone breaks free from AT&T; this fall (fingers crossed).  My current Motorola phone with Sprint is dying and I do not want to make an expensive phone purchase or get locked into a 2 year contract.  This phone looked like a good option.I have had no problems with signal or dropped calls; in fact, coverage with this phone is better then Sprint.  The clarity of phone calls was fine.  The phone is smaller then I thought it would be, it measures 4\" x 2\" and almost 3/4\" thick.  It does not have an antenna that sticks out like most flip phones, which is nice.  The buttons are large and easy to press.  No misdialing.  The font on the screen is also large.  The back of the phone has a large green button for quick access to emergency numbers.  The front of the phone has two lights, one for battery status and the other to signal new texts.  The package includes the phone, wall charger, carrying strap and earphones.The set up is basic but easy.  I like the functionality more then my present phone since too many features can get in the way of accessing them.  You scroll through the menu of Phonebook (100 entry); Games (Robot & UFO,); Settings for Ring (20 melodies), Alarm (7), Opening (7), Closing (7) and Message (7); Call Log; FM Radio (can set stations but must use earphones to access this feature); Calculator; Calendar (you can add tasks) and Alarm. The phone is bluetooth enabled and the earphones have a clip to help keep in place.The cost ($50) is very reasonable and it requires no contract. Consumer Cellular offers affordable monthly plans ($20/month for 250 minutes or $10/month with $.25 per minute) and although not affiliated with AT&T;, uses their network.  I found Consumer Cellular customer service to be excellent but if you wanted to go elsewhere, they will provide you with a pass code to unlock the phone (it uses a SIM card).  Just note that they cannot guarantee features if an outside carrier is used.This would be the perfect choice for young kids, seniors (endorsed by the AARP for a reason) or those who need a cell phone just for emergencies. It is not the trendiest or most advanced on the market but it does perform well.  If you are looking for a reliable and solid cell phone, this is the phone for you!

My last phone was a prepaid Tracfone I had several years ago and it basically died then so I didn't have a phone. Then not have a phone was driving me nuts! Having an iPod touch with this app called Line2 was almost an alternative. Costing only $15 for unlimited talk and text, which was a steal. The only con was, I didn't have wifi at home and I had to go out for wifi at my local supermarket. I was aching my mother to get a phone by adding me to the plan and I would pay my portion. I looked at the Droid phones, admiring this one and the Droid X. I looked at the reviews and noticed there was sucky battery life for the Incredible mostly, but I saw I can get a better battery. I went down to Hhgregg with my parents and saw the Droid X for 200 (uh, no thank you, pass!) and the Incredible for 50. The choice was obviously clear. I could get most of the features of the X minus the HDMI and larger screen but also minus 150 bucks. I was planning on getting a phone by myself if it they weren't going to do it, but they ended up getting me one and they got one for themesleves as well. I've been ordering accessories like the extended battery (which I'm using right now) and the holster I'm waiting on. The only downside with the extended battery I got was there isn't a case for me to fit it on, unless I cut like a rubber one up or something to fit it. But I say it's worth it. I'll go into more details about the battery life, but first, the perks of this phone :)First off, is the OS. I found it to be very intuitive and fairly customizable compared to my 4th gen iPod touch. I also love the fact that I can put widgets on there, making it my very own! I also love the Live Wallpapers and I can even put an animated gif as a background (if I can do it right). And yes, you can play animated gifs with this unlike the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad =) I could do it through my touch, but I had to use this app that I had to buy and download them onto my touch through iTunes and who wants that! :( But if you want them to repeat over and over again, you'll have to download an animated gif viewer, which is free ^^ Another thing is that if you're an iPhone user and want to switch to a phone like this, but want all of those apps, don't worry. Even if it's not as near as populated as the iPhone App Store, the Android Market is still an awesome place. Over 40% of the apps are free vs only 28% free apps on iPhone's Apps store. Plus, I got some apps that were on the iPhone app store on the Android one. Notably, apps like some of the EA games, Gamevil games, Gameloft games, and other apps like Pandora and Autodesk Sketchbook Mobile (yes, I draw on my phone. Deal with it >:)) are on the Android Market and most-likely more to come. Also has emulators that you can play with. Yay! ^^Another perk is that you can actually have Flash Player 10.1 (I know, it's awesome!) with upgrade of Android 2.2 Froyo. Plus, you still have access to HTML5 so it's all good. Another advantage over the iPhone! Though you can't access Hulu, most of the flash is better than none =) Hulu is the only site that I've encountered where I can't use flash. And you can play flash games too, if it's not hard enough. One other awesome thing is that you can actually download files to this phone such as mp3 and actually listen to it! This thing is closer to a mobile computer than even the iPad is and I've wanted one forever! I can even upload photos and artwork to websites like DeviantArt ^^One more perk before I get to the cons is the unlimited data package. This will come in handy because if you want unlimited texting or calling and I'll show you why. Thanks to the Line2 app that was on the App Store, I was able to make calls with it on my iPod touch. But it has crossed over to the Android Market and you know what that means. Think about it. Unlimited 3G data plus Line2 equals total epicness of unlimited possibilities! I can talk to people all over the U.S. and Canada as well as send text messages even if they aren't Verizon customers! The app adds a second line to the phone, but it's really convenient. You can even do a conference call which you can have multiple people on the line! Only downside is that picture/video messaging isn't supported yet. Also, you won't be able to assign a custom ringtone to calls and texts, but one can't be too picky as this can save you over 65 bucks with combined unlimited talk and text! Plus the app is free for download and you get a 30 day trial to see if you like it or not before signing up for it! Never worry about sending too many texts or wasting minutes ever again! =)Another perk is the camera. This is close to the best camera on a phone as you can get, except for this Sony Ericson Phone, which I heard sucked. But it takes great pictures with the 8mp camera and it has great 720p video recording. It ALMOST replaces my camcorder. Not entirely since it does full 1080p HD recording and has a 10mp camera. It's more convenient to carry a camera phone around than have both, but for special occasions and projects, I would stick to my camcorder. I still love the options of the camera such as the ISO (or whatever it is), the exposure, and awesome looking filters =). I think the HTC Sense has something to do with that so I'm not sure about the similar features on the Droid X and the Droid 2 Global.Alright, here's the part that we've been dreading, which are the downsides. One huge downside is the battery life. Before I got my extended battery, this thing wouldn't last even half it's charge when I was watching an hour's worth of youtube videos. If you're a heavy user, do what I did and get an extended battery. I got the 3500 mAH extended battery by Acase. It lasts signifigantly longer and I had a live wallpaper up, watched a flash video my girlfriend sent me, played Star Fox with an SNES emulator, checked my texts and facebook, and it was still above half of it's power and that was from 7 to 11:30 in the morning. That might sound bad, but think of it this way. A typical computer lasts about that time, maybe even less depending on what you're doing. I'm sure if you don't do much with it, only using it for checking texts and emails and make a few calls, and maybe watch a few youtube videos, this thing should get you through the day. But you have to charge it properly by letting it die all the way the first 3 to 4 times and leave it on the charge 2 to 3 hours after it's done charging. I'm thinking of getting this other battery to test it and give one of the batteries to my mom or dad. But I've on had this battery since yesterday so I'll update this review and let you guys know what happens. =) I got my extended battery for like $31, with shipping included. One other con is the virtual keyboard. It's an OK texter, but not always accurate as my iPod touch's virtual keyboard. But it does have auto-correction and you can use speech text to speak into the mic and it'll have the text on there. If you don't like virtual texting, go for the Droid 2. Another con, which isn't a big deal is rooting. In case you don't know what that is, it's like jailbreaking for the iPhone, but not really. Like jailbreaking, rooting voids your warranty on your Android device. It unlocks your phone and you can customize it however you please, but you have to know what you're doing or you'll screw up your phone. Thankfully, my problem was fixable and I could care less about rooting now. One last con is that you can't take snapshots of your screen like you can on the iDevices where you hold the lock button and press the home key. I don't know why they have to be rooted in order to do that, so I'll just take a picture of my phone. Maybe they'll come out with and update or app for that.Now, despite it's cons, this is a great phone and I love my Incredible Droid =) It pretty much lives up to it's name and I can make it almost anyway I want and I can do almost anything with it! It's that Incredible! I hope this review was helpful to you newbies at smartphones as well as smartphone users in general. Like I said, I'll post an update on how the battery is in a few days. If you're like me, get this phone. You won't regret it. ;)Update: I had the Acase and it sucked. It hardly had an improvement. I ordered the Seidio 3500 mAH and I'm using it right now. I'm loving it! You can read my reviews on these batteries on Amazon by searching for them =) It may have given thickness to my phone, but it's worth it. I can just cut the part of the area where the battery is out. I ordered a case and I'll keep you guys posted on how it turns out.I also have a couple of applications that I thought should make your Incredible, well, even more Incredible. You can customize the lock and theme to your phone without rooting! Complements of 91Pandahome and Lock Bot Pro. =) Also, I found that you can download apps that you can actually tether without the monthly free! I won't mention any since I don't want them taken down, but I don't have to go out for wifi anymore hardly! I can use the unlimited data plan on my phone and connect it to my laptop via USB! The internet isn't bad either for 3G. It buffers sometimes with videos when I have like 2 bars or less. But it's still a lot faster than dial-up (bad memories). I love this phone a lot and I continue to love what I can do with this thing and make new discoveries with it. =) I'm glad I got this phone and I don't regret it.Update 2: I've had my Seidio extended battery and it makes the Incredible even more so Incredible. In case you're worried about a case not fitting, try going for a rubber one where you can cut through it easily so you can have the battery stick out. I got the Crazyondigital one in blue on Amazon for less than four bucks altogether. That'll save you a lot of money over Verizon's cases they have to offer for this phone. Also, I just recently decided to go ahead and root my phone. Totally worth it if you want to take screenshots and get free \"wireless\" tethering. Also, if you can do it just right, you can change the interface entirely or even install Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). I haven't done that yet, but when I figure it out, I'll tell you if its worth it or not. =) I really want to be able to use apps that don't support HTC sense. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but it can be a pain sometimes when it comes to compatibility. That's just my take on it. Still loving my phone and Android period ;) I hope you will too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent phone for new smartphone users and smartphone users in general!!", "unixReviewTime": 1297382400, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011"}

HTC has done a great job with the Incredible.  The phone is freakishly fast.  It's faster than my desktop.  The battery get's slammed a lot but if you consider the amount of work the processor is doing and how fast it is doing it, it is acceptable.  My girlfriend got the LG Ally so we could compare.  I chose to stay with the Incredible.  I gave up some battery for the faster speed.I thought I was going to need the separate keyboard but I am fast now on the screen tap.

It has a harder time taking good pictures than my purpose built camera.  It has trouble with light sometimes.  Some pictures are perfect.  Video seems fine.  Being able to instantly send pix and vids via email or text is priceless.One thing I don't like about the Android phones is the unbelievable lack of control.  You can't stop apps from starting up when they want to.  Apps that are built in, you can't remoove.  I've learned to closely monitor parts of the phone.  I leave the location function off so the apps don't send out my location.  I turn off the web when I'm not using it so the phone doesn't continually update apps.  I use app killer to shut down apps that start themselves.Skype is useless to me because Verizon does not allow its use with wifi.  What??  That's how I use it in other countries.With everything off, the battery is good for a couple of days.  If I am using the internet heavily, it is good for a few hours.  It's not a problem because I have a 110v usb charger for the house or when I'm near a computer and a 12v for the car.  I went ahead and bought a larger battery.

Reception and transmission is great. The graphics are crisp and clear and calls can be made from Wi-Fi with 3G  turned off. I purchased the Seidio 3500 MAH extended battery which helps immensely in terms of battery life. Turning off the non essential uses helps me to go two or three days without charging, depending on how much surfing I do. The phone has a couple of draw backs. The virtual keyboard is tiny and a PITA for a texter or intensive user. I would recommend the SWYPE keyboard for extensive use. Still, all in all it is fine for short e-mails. The camera, as others have noted, is not great. It takes a lot of experience to start getting decent photos out of it. Still not bad for the occasional snapper. One of the phone's high points for me is its compact size. I do not need or want a huge screen. I prefer the Incredibles compact size. The graphics are so crisp that the 3.7\" screen is fine, and my eyes are not 20/20. Lots of APPs are available on Market for it and it seems to handle the ones I have downloaded very well so far. The phone is a dream to customize for those who wish to root the device or do other customizations.

This is my 5th smartphone and I've had 3 different iPhones.  This phone is very fast, has a decent camera and can meet all my needs.  I am not thrilled about syncing all my stuff through gmail, but so far so good.  The battery life is as bad as reported and yes, I know smartphones use them up.  I've acclimated pretty quickly as to how to use it and not deplete the battery too fast.  If you use the navigation app, surf the web and use Pandora at the same time, you'll burn it out in under 3 hours, but once you know this, you use what you need when you need it.  I can get through a moderate day with a full night charge and then one mid-day charge and I'm okay with that.  Speaking of the navigation, just wow.  Free turn by turn navigation.  I am also syncing my music with iTunes.  Didn't know you could do that.I had to move from my iPhone 4 and AT&T; to Verizon for work and I thought it would stink, but I was wrong.  I like to tinker and Android suits that just fine.  And Verizon customer service is very good as well.  Overall, for a free smartphone, I am extremely satisfied.  And very surprised.  I went through Amazon Wireless and spoke to them before purchase.  Everything they said happened.  I was able to buy the phone through Amazon and set up the plan I wanted with Verizon.  In my area, they offer unlimited mobile to mobile on any network and this was not offered through the Amazon website.  Got the phone, called Verizon and had that option put on my plan.  If you have questions, call Amazon Wireless - they are pretty solid.1/11/11 UpdateI like the phone even more now.  One feature of Froyo (Android 2.2) that no one knows or mentions, is that it will monitor how you use your phone and adjust certain features to maximize your battery.  My battery life is now far better than when I first reviewed.  I am still stunned at how happy I am with this phone.  Is the iPhone 4 better?  Yes.  But this phone is so close, it doesn't matter to me.  And for free?  BTW - the processor in this phone is still regarded as one of the best - the 1Ghz Snapdragon.  Also, a couple of tech blogs at the end of the year still said this was the best smartphone on Verizon - 7 months after launch.3/27/11 UpdateThe battery on this is unacceptable.  I've made excuses for it, but now I realize it's the weakest aspect of this phone.  I unplug the phone from the charger when I leave work and with moderate use (2-3 texts, 2-3 phone calls, 5 minutes websurfing, 10 minutes navigation) I use up 90% of the battery.  It's a huge shortfall of this phone.

I have (secretly) wanted an Android device for several months now having originally started my smartphone experience with a Palm Treo 650 (at the time I LOVED that phone), I upgraded to the 700p and subsequently the 755p before making the HUGE leap to another OS altogether with my first Blackberry, a Bold using AT&T.; While I had viewed most BB users as arrogant A-Holes (for the most part, entirely unjustified of course) I reluctantly began to not only like the BB platform, but slowly I came to prefer it. I still maintain that BB's are NOT as out-of-the-box user-friendly as ANY of the ancient Palm devices, but I really appreciated what it COULD do that my Palm couldn't.I became--again, quite reluctantly--a power Blackberry user. Unfortunately I was attached to the abysmal AT&T; service, which has almost a universal bad rep for spotty (at best) service. They brag (and brag and brag...) about having the 'Nations Fastest 3G Service', which may be true--however what GOOD is it when your phone cannot receive a signal in the same location where my wife's Verizon BB Curve had 3G service?? I'll take reliable connection over spotty and fast 3G service ANY day. Long story short, I had to trade my phone in and without having to explain WHY, I was given a Windows Mobile Tilt 2 as a replacement (not MY choice--it was a promotional thing which I had zero control over). This proved to be without a doubt, the WORST phone I have ever used or even heard of. I applaud HTC's design, the phone itself was very nice (although it WAS amazingly heavy--easily the heaviest I have ever owned, by quite a large margin, too)...what I did NOT like was the HUGELY unreliable Windows Mobile platform. My phone froze on me multiple times per day and I couldn't wait to get rid of it. I went back to BB only this time I finally signed onto Verizon and LOVED my Tour.I decided it was time to upgrade and while I LIKE the iPhones, I have serious issues with Apple in particular and how they have twisted so many people into thinking their devices are superior 'Just 'Cuz' they're made by Apple, thereby also making the owners superior as well. While my initial thoughts of BB owners, once upon a time was unjustified, I have to say that my opinions of the vast majority of iPhone owners I have run into have been pretty much right on the money: arrogant A-Holes. Sorry, but its true--not ALL of them, mind you, just those I seem to run into, apparently.I have been eyeing the Droid X for quite some time, but the wait to get one seemed impossibly long. I went ahead and got the Incredible based on several comments by the Verizon employee assuring me that other than screen size, the Incredible was its equal. She insisted it came pre-loaded with a 16gb SD card--it did not (2gb) and also had the 2.2 Froyo update as well--it does not, at least not yet. Based on this information, knowing that along with 2.2 the Incredible is supposed to have mini WiFi hotspot capabilities as well as HD video recording, I went ahead and got one all the while in the back of my mind knowing that if I didn't like it, I could always bring it back within 30 days. Sure 'nuff, no 2.2 OR 16gb card, which really pissed me off. How is it the employee (a manager no less) would NOT know this? Honestly I think she was just seeing a guaranteed sale and put on her Used Car Salesman sportcoat and said whatever I wanted to hear in order to make a quick sell.With that being said, the Incredible really IS a fantastic phone. Honestly, with the amount of texting I do just between my wife and children and me, the Speech-To-Text feature is worth the cost alone. While not 100% accurate and good for pretty much just short comments, using it while driving is a LIFE saver--literally, and I am NOT endorsing texting while driving, mind you. Its SO simple, instead of playing around with the 'virtual keyboard' which is hard enough to use--and downright stupid to do while driving. I still believe that driving and using a cell phone is stupid, which is why I believe this feature to be so great. The number of apps I have found are amazing...and best of all: most are FREE. Sure you'll find more than twice the number of apps available for the iPhone, but come on, seriously, how many apps do we NEED?? It took me over an hour to just browse a small fraction and I found more than what I will ever use in that time. If you prefer iPhones and their apps, that is fine, I'm just saying you can find JUST as many really useful apps for Android devices and much, MUCH more free apps than you will ever see available for iPhones, iPads and whatnot. As new as the Android platform is, to have as many apps available as it does clearly puts it ahead of how far apples app store was at in the same time frame.The live wallpaper is just awesome. Its entirely useless I'll admit, but amazingly cool nevertheless. I really like how I can customize my phone however I see fit. I really like the fact that whenever I see fit, I can change my phone any way I want. Just cool. The touch screen is very responsive--almost too responsive--and you'd have to experience it to understand I guess. The optical track pad is a nice addition, especially for the times when I want to edit on the screen but my fingers were too big (another reason I want an X), however if there is a way to adjust the sensitivity of the pad, I couldn't find it, and I wish I could. Also, when looking up a contact, I couldn't immediately pull up an on-screen keyboard in order to begin a text, which was a bit frustrating, especially if alphabetically their name was far down on my list...it took that much longer to get TO the contact. If there is an easy way around this, someone please let me know. Having the weather on the main screen with the ability to update whenever I want is convenient, and unlike the same similar feature that was included on my old HTC Tilt 2, this one automatically grabs the weather from the area closest to where its receiving your signal from--all without you asking. I suppose you can pick from different cities, but as a general rule, I only want to know what the weather is like where I currently am, so I am perfectly satisfied with this feature as is.The camera takes rather great pics--so far the best I've personally seen from a camera. Unfortunately as is normal for cell phones, as soon as it becomes dark, your ability to take better pics becomes dramatically reduced. Lets just say, for everyday point-and-shoot situations in decent light, this camera is a pretty good substitute for your regular digital camera. The photos--while 8MP in resolution, as we've all seen thanks to the fantastic processing on the iPhone 4's 5MP camera, more does not necessarily mean better. This is one area where the iPhone truly does excell ahead of all major phones available at the moment, although that probably will change here within the year I would imagine.For a phone with a 1Gig processor, switching between texting chats certainly can take up to 5-6 seconds before it opens up the screen, which I just did not expect. Most everything else is as quick as I've been hearing from other users, but to open a chat log in texts takes MUCH more time than I expected, and to be honest, longer than my 2 year old BB Tour did. However, in every OTHER way it is blazing fast...especially with the internet. Coming from a BB which, as we ALL know has just about the worst browser available on a hand-held device, man I gotta tell you I felt like I was connected to DSL speeds like my home computer...and while that comparison is mighty generous, it really isn't all that far off the mark. Pages load incredibly fast with this browser, which I put on par with the iPhone in EVERY way--and once this receives update 2.2 it'll blow it out of the water...literally.The screen is, well, wonderfully vivid and easily the best I have owned (thus far). Pictures are crisp, clear and detail is always easily projected. I have only seen an iPhone 4 briefly, and while everyone seems to universally praise it for having the best screen available to any smartphone at the moment, I think you'd have to have beyond normal vision to be able to look at one and say with absolute certainty that you can clearly see a major difference between one and the other. Seriously, phone pixel density is becoming so good these days that almost nobody can honestly see a measurable difference. I'm not saying you CANNOT see one, but I AM saying that what difference there is, well, has to be a minor one at best. I am 100% certain however, that there will be apple fans who cannot help but disagree vigorously, and while my eyesight isn't what it used to be, its good enough to say this with confidence. I am NOT knocking the iPhone here at all, either. It has an amazingly clear, crisp and vibrant screen. I just think the gap between that and the incredibles screen is closing rather quickly, thats all.Battery life is lacking to say the least. This is one place where the iPhone not only is the clear winner, but knocks one outta the park in comparison. Supposedly with 2.2 battery life will increase dramatically, but until I get that update, it pays to purchase a car charger and never be very far away from an outlet, either. Honestly, the battery life is dismal--at best...and I have worked hard to organize my phone in such a way that I use only what is necessary. I dim the screen, don't use bluetooth or WiFi hardly at all and even just sitting on my desk it saps the battery down noticeably in a short amount of time. Sorry, but this is ridiculous, especially knowing that the Droid X with a MUCH larger screen has a great deal better battery life than my smaller one...? This is one area where I believe the Incredible doesn't just do poorly, it downright fails--and is my ONLY major gripe about this device.Call quality seems good to excellent. Speaker volume was exceptional. Love the app Market for Android. My wife and I were wondering where to go for dinner, and within 90 seconds, I had found an app to help me find a place to eat, downloaded it and received directions on my screen. Amazing. While we were at dinner, I downloaded Flixter (for free), found the closest theater, and even watched a theatrical trailer for the movie we wanted to see, all within about 90 seconds. Sorry, but this is one way in which the Android platform is not just better, but head & shoulders superior to iPhone and the slow & clunky way you have to access their app store. Again, if you are okay with this, then fine. I happen to like doing things this way, personally.All in all, I have to say that this phone is purely awesome, and such a leap ahead of my BB that words hardly can describe. The ONLY area in which BB's STILL continue to dominate is in push e-mail delivery, regardless of where your email comes from. I still can't help but wonder why no other carrier or manufacturer after ALL this time, still cannot mimic the push email with the same ease of set-up and swift delivery that BB has delivered for YEARS. Oh well, that is--in MY opinion--the ONLY place where android suffers. While the calendar application isn't as polished as say my ancient Palm Treo was (face it, Palm RULED when it came to organizing schedules, which is what it was originally designed to handle), but what I have is certainly workable, and I'm absolutely certain that right now if I looked hard enough, I could find a FREE calendar app to download that would give me everything I need...heck, maybe I'll run and fetch that right now...and thankfully because I am not tied down to my home computer with iTunes, I can download it on the fly wherever I am as long as I have a decent connection--which, thanks to Verizon is just about everywhere I plan to go.Before I get hateful responses, let me say this: clearly apple manufactures an amazing product in the iPhone. I find it interesting that literally out of nowhere, when it debuted, the iPhone instantly became the phone to beat. Just look at all the smartphones available today, they are ALL judged by the iPhone standard and almost no other. When a new phone comes out, they almost always are compared to the iPhone--and there is good reason for this. Some like everything about apple, Steve Jobs and all that goes with it. Face it, Steve has done an amazing job--like him or not, thats just a fact. With the iPhone 4's reception issues aside, it is clearly still the phone to beat out there. Has Android made a better platform than iOS? Yes & No. In some ways I believe the Android OS is clearly superior and in some ways the iPhone is. At this moment, it basically comes down mostly to what you personally prefer (unless you aren't a fan of AT&T;). If I weren't on Verizon and I lived elsewhere I probably would own an iPhone myself--but having been ON the AT&T; service for a little over a year, I can say that at least in the area that I live, it isn't an option because their coverage is so poor. But when it comes to comparing one phone to another, you need to do your research and go with what you personally like, and if thats an iPhone, good, if its something else? Fine. Do what YOU want, and don't let anyone tell you differently.I think that if you are a fan of the android OS then you cannot go wrong with the Incredible...unfortunately, without my reading glasses, I need the X in order to fully explore everything my phone is capable of...and admitting that is certainly not a simple thing to do in my case.***UPDATE***After using the phone for over a week now, I am STILL impressed as I (im)patiently wait for the next stock of Droid X's to arrive. One additional thing I really like about the HTC Sense UI that I believe is not available on the X (however I am NOT 100% sure of this) is how I access the calendar, choose a specific date, and as long as it isn't too far ahead, at the bottom of the screen will be the weather prediction for that day. While I don't put an aweful lot of faith in the typical meteorologists ability to accurately predict anything beyond 36 hours at best, it still is a pretty nifty feature to have.One thing I found weird was that the phone did NOT come with a full user manual. It DID come with a Tips & Tricks booklet, but that essentially is good for just unboxing the phone for the first time & getting it started. I downloaded the manual from the internet, but again, the script was small enough that reading it and scrolling from one page to the next to find what I wanted was a bit too inconvenient for me to want to rely on it for very long. I'll stick to reading about it on a PDF on my home PC.If I had to add a small-but significant gripe, the charging light, which also doubles as a blinking alert when you receive a text or email is quite a bit smaller and much harder to see than on my old BB. I wish that while it was charging that it could still somehow alert you to a new message, but unless you feel & hear it vibrate, tough luck. To the left of the Verizon logo just underneath the speaker in front I can make out an alert light of some kind, but I have no idea what it is for. It hasn't gone off once since I have used my phone and haven't found what its purpose is for in the manual, either. I suppose I'll keep looking it up til I find out.Its nice to receive alerts to new updates for specific apps I've installed...and I never went looking to see if they had updated, I just received the notice overnight and gave me the choice to update if I wanted. STILL waiting on the update to Froyo 2.2 but I suppose I'll just have to wait that one out. Verizon confirmed that the update was ready and they started sending them out wirelessly as of Friday August 27th, but they were doing it region-by-region and I am pretty sure that the higher populated areas will get theirs first and soforth (meaning I'll get it last more than likely). I found where I could manually download from google direct the update, but I have read too many stories of how the phone didn't work properly if done even slightly incorrect to even a few horror stories that afterwards the phone ended up bricked as a result of missing a step or not doing everything literally EXACT. As much as I want better battery life--which apparently seems to be one of the many by-products for the Incredible while using 2.2--I'm gonna wait 'til it arrives from Verizon directly. I just hope it doesn't take much longer.***UPDATE #2***Woke up this morning with a notice saying Froyo 2.2 HAD arrived. The OTA update took maybe 7-8 mins and I lost no data--which seems to be an issue, or at least a worry of some Incredible owners. I have noticed a few new perks right up front: 1 new live wallpaper (the background that we always see on the Nexus 1), an app for mobile hotspot and faster internet browser...it isn't THAT much faster because, lets face it: it was already pretty dang fast. The dInc already had Flash Lite, so haven't had time to mess with other websites sportin' Flash just yet, but I will.I noticed that the texting threads look a bit different, and the SEND button is no longer there...it has been replaced with an icon that I wasn't too sure what it did--at first. While it isn't a big deal, especially since I figured out how to send my texts once ready, I gotta wonder why they would get rid of such an obvious button like SEND? Weird.So far battery life is dramatically improved with the new update. Normally between waking up and arriving to work my battery will have noticeably drained, but not nearly to the same degree now. My phone also seems faster to respond going from task, to task. I hope this isn't wishful thinking. Yesterday I found a Direct Message shortcut to texting so I don't experience the MAJOR 6-7 second lag (it got worse) it would take to open up a single threaded text message...which had to be my BIGGEST complaint against the phone. Finding a way around it was absolute pure bliss to be honest.As another reviewer noted, I suppose the only real drawback to owning an android phone is how UN-Productive you can be become because of spending so much time playing with the darned thing. Seriously, it seems that daily I find a new and really cool new thing it can do. I haven't been this happy with an electronic device since--well, since, I guess I've never BEEN this excited before because I've never owned anything that can do as much as it can--and I haven't even scratched the surface of what its full potential is.One more thing: I am VERY impressed with how thin the phone is. I know iPhone claims the new model is the thinnest smartphone available, but I'm sorry, but if it is, then it sure isn't by any degree that I can see with the naked eye. I also LOVE the rubberized coating on the back. I know not everyone likes that particular style, but it sure feels comfortable in my hand. I know I am still looking forward to whenever my X will arrive, but it certainly seems that after each day goes by, I contemplate keeping the Incredible more and more. Who knows? I just might hang onto it after all...***UPDATE #3***A few things to point out with the upgrade to Froyo 2.2 on the DInc...I now have additional apps that came with it that CANNOT be deleted--removed, or--it would seem--be able to even stop from running in the background. The Skype app seems to start spontaneously all by itself and even when I force it to stop, every now and then I'll see it start up all by itself. This is inexcuseable to FORCE us to run an app--unless we WANT to. Plain and simple. I love how I can custom organize almost everything about my DInc, but making it so my phone will slow down due to unwanted apps running in the background--and ensure that I won't be able to stop them is not just a problem for HTC, Android and Verizon, but something that I feel will force otherwise BIG fans of the Google service off to something else entirely. In the grand scheme of things, is Skype running in the background THAT big of a deal? Maybe not to everyone, but I guarantee it is a big deal for many--including me. It really upsets me that when I use Task Manager to close specific programs, I find out later that certain apps RE-Started again ALL BY THEMSELVES.Hey Verizon! If you're reading this: FIX IT NOW. Android really IS (IMO) a fantastic OS--however, if you go all Big Brother on us, you're going to find fewer and fewer people attracted to buying your phones. I expect another OTA fix to arrive and correct this monumental blunder soon or I may switch to something else entirely--which is really sad because otherwise I really LOVE this phone.***UPDATE #4***Just found a place to download Swype for my phone. Originally I had found SlideIT in the Marketplace for free--and it is almost identical in every way--except it was just a Demo, and after a few days it expired...and being the amazingly cheap individual that I am, I searched and searched (it DID take awhile) until I found where I could download Swype for free (the Beta Testing was over, dangit!). I had to do a bit of fidgeting to figure it out all the way, but I did it, and now I've got it and I LOVE it. If anyone believes they can text using a real keyboard OR a virtual one faster than using Swype, TRUST me, they are fooling themselves. Swype (or SlideIT if you're willing to pay 'cuz you can't find Swype for free) blows both of them out of the water by a pretty huge margin. I know some believe they CAN text faster using an actual keyboard, but I highly doubt it (ie NO freakin' way).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "LEAPS Ahead of my BB Tour--but battery life is dismal at best", "unixReviewTime": 1282867200, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2010"}

The hardware is nice, great screen and good functional buttons across the bottom. But the hardware is not where this phone distinguishes itself.  After spending the last two years with the BlackBerry Storm and RIM's OS 5.0, moving to Android 2.2 is so satisfying, especially since I am no longer doing battery pulls throughout the day. I finally feel like I arrived at the app party, as the BB App World just wasn't doing it for me. And while I was sad to leave BB Messenger (the strongest reason to stick with BB for your personal device needs and the only thing that is keeping RIM alive outside of corporate email), I easily found an app that essentially replaces BBM for free. The Android Marketplace is easy to navigate and includes anything you would want, and often multiple versions of it. And while it is true that Android OS makes this phone what it is, users also get the benefit of the HTC user interface. In my mind, the HTC Sense interface is why people love this phone more than anything Motorola puts out. Needless to say, I am extremely happy with my switch and there is little I would change with this phone. I have customized this phone and this will be my can't-live-without device for at least the next two years. To beat the battery issues, I have taken to bringing my charger with me to work and charging it fully before I leave for the day in addition to charging it over night. Yes it's a pain, but this is what's necessary when you must always be connected.

The Processor is responsive and it has a lot of RAM. The Sound is the best that I've heard on a Smart Phone (and I've owned several). I haven't had many hiccups while gaming or running applications. It's light and somewhat resembles the Iphone.Cons:The Battery Life on this phone is absolutely horrible. It will last around 2 hours of constant use and drains quickly on standby (sometimes I worry that it will be dead in the morning if I don't leave it on the charger). The Screen is very prone to getting scratched. It picked up a lot of little scuffs from just being in my pocket by itself. I've treated it the same way that I treated my iPhone and I never found a mark on my iPhone. The Camera is really bad as well. You'll push the button to take a picture and there is a significant delay before it actually takes the picture. This makes getting the perfect shot very difficult. The Video is very average and does not live up to its specifications. This phone also comes with a lot of bloatware that cannot be removed without rooting (hacking) the phone. Overall this bloatware is constantly running in the background and significantly stunts the powerful processor.Conclusion:If you buy this phone, be prepared to purchase Screen Protectors for it. The screen WILL get scratched if you do use them. I also would not recommend this phone to someone who is not prepared to root it in order to remove all the bloatware. You honestly get about half performance if you leave all the extra stuff running in the background.

Even tho it u r buying it thru Verizon Wireless, they are really just subcontracting with Verizon so I must put a disclaimer that all my issues I had were with Verizon & with HTC not making sure that they phones worked properly before they were released (which was a huge problem with these phones & caused them to be quasi-recalled).I have to say on the positive side, even tho the phone came about 2 weeks later than it originally said it would, I still got it 2 MONTHS faster than I would have it I purchased it directly from Verizon. Unfortunately, the reason Verizon sold out so quickly & didn't get any phones in for such a long time was bc they had problems with the phone. I got my phones much, much sooner, but then I got phones with MAJOR problems.They had very, very poor signal quality & were constantly dropping calls. One day alone I counted over 20 dropped calls before I became so angry & just shut the stupid phone off. Both my husband & I had to argue & argue & argue with Verizon to get new phones. We had to first go thru their protocall to make sure it's our phones & not something else. We went thru that which was a huge pain bc our phones were wiped out like 4 times & u have reload programs, contacts, etc. Also, we were told at 2 different Verizon stores they couldn't handle fixing the problem so call tech support. Call tech support & the say take it into the store! It took us 6 weeks due to all of this running around for them to determine the problems were with our phones & not their system. However, they have a 30 day return policy. We were sooo upset at first bc they were not going to replace our phones bc it was beyond the 30 day warranty & they couldn't get their money back from the manufacturer now & it would come out of their (Verizon) own pocket. However, they had it all documented that we had problems from the beginning & did exactly what they said to do & that caused it to go beyond the 30 day period. Finally, after going round & round we got new phones which work much better, but still have poor signal quality & sometimes drop phone calls. I'm an attorney & used to dealing with difficult situations & people, but this whole experience was really bad.It's so frustrating when u pay $230 per month & u can't even use the dog gone phone. We don't have a land line either so it was not fun when we had no phone services at all. We were with US Cellular for almost 20 years before this & never, ever had these problems, tho we had normal flip phones, not smart phones.

The device is large enough to allow for a proper smartphone experience, yet not large enough to become a cumbersome burden on a daily basis.- HTC's software perfectly complements the Android OS.  The Sense software overlay is both practical and visually appealing, especially in contrast to the stock Android software, which is quite spartan in comparison.- Typing messages and e-mails was a breeze with the on-screen keyboard.  I didn't experience any lag while typing, and the inclusion of a period and comma button on the first layer of the keyboard was very helpful.- The phone's spec sheet points out that the hardware packs plenty of horsepower, and indeed I didn't experience any lag while performing functions with the device, including multi-tasking.- Push e-mail was every bit as reliable as any Blackberry with the G-Mail app.  The standard e-mail app syncs every fifteen minutes, which is more than bearable for most users.- Web browsing on the device was speedy, and the browser rarely stalled on any webpage. In two weeks of usage, the web browser failed to load a page only twice, which is remarkable when considering how much I used it.  Download speeds were pretty good over Verizon's network; I averaged 800-1200 kbps down and 500-900 up.- Android Market has plenty of apps to increase productivity and occupy time; but my past Android phones were slow to load and install apps.  The Droid Incredible downloaded and installed apps with impressive speed.- If your into aesthetic appeal, the device is attractive and professional looking.Cons:- As mentioned, while the Droid Incredible was an outstanding device, it was a mediocre phone based on my experience.  Call quality was the worst i've ever experienced on any Verizon phone.  It was nearly as bad as any At&t; phone i've used in my area (and At&t; has notoriously poor call quality in this region).  I'd grade the call quality roughly six out of ten, give and take half a point depending on location.  At times, the phone sounded fine, and during others, sounded like the other person was talking through a sheet of wax paper.  There was some muffling, and roughly one of every twelve to fifteen syllables was lost in the transmission.  If your looking for a phone with great call quality, I really can't recommend this one.- It should be noted that the topic of the Droid Incredible's call quality has been heavily discussed online.  Some users like myself experienced poor call quality, others achieved the opposite result.  While I acknowledge my particular device could have been a \"lemon,\" your probably taking a fifty/fifty chance on call quality if you purchase this one.- The Droid Incredible exhibited Blackberry-esque signal bounce.  The device gets good reception, but the cellular antenna is very sensitive.  When I didn't hold the device at the top, reception would fluctuate as much as as 23db.- An eccentric characteristic of the Droid Incredible is that it's stock signal indicator didn't seem to work.  A quick download of the RealSignal app from Android Market was a painless fix to the problem, but in 2011, this shouldn't have been a problem to begin with.- Battery life is a little below average for a smartphone.  It's acceptable if you properly condition the battery during the first 5-7 days of usage; after that time, I noticed my battery life almost doubled.  However, it was still slightly sub-par after conditioning.The HTC Droid Incredible gets four stars for two reasons; Amazon won't let me give it a 3.5 rating, and the device shines where it was designed to shine.  It offers a great smartphone and multimedia experience, and I recognize that many within the phone's target audience won't actually be averaging the two hours of calling per day that I do.  I'd recommend the phone to those who average fewer than twenty minutes of calling per day, and who don't mind carrying around a car charger or spare charger and possibly an extra battery.

Do you want a sleek, sparkly little sliver of plastic with \"apps\" and a screen that does tricks when you poke it? If so, run. Run back to your cozy little Starbucks and...blog, or whatever it is you people do. This is a phone for men and hardy women. This is a phone with which you could bludgeon a wolverine. You do not text with this phone. You do not Tweet. You call people and tell them how it's going to be. True, you can do that with lots of phones--but with this one, you can do it while fording the turgid waters of the Nile. You can use its horrid little camera to record new and grotesque species in the depths of the Amazon Basin. You can make dinner reservations for two at that Hungarian place on 34th while galloping toward the airfield pursued by a mysterious hitman. You'll deal with him later.Oh, and it's really not that hard to get internet, etc.--See D. Henry's review for directions.The one thing I don't like is that you have to set the clock again every time you swap out the battery. That gets kind of annoying.6 MONTH UPDATE:Having now owned this phone for half a year, I stand fully behind my initial review. I moved to a different continent, and it welcomed the new SIM card with open arms--and I got the internet working here, too. I've capsized with this clipped to the straps of my kayak and watched most of my equipment ripped loose as the craft was scraped over partially-submerged trees by the torrent.

The flashlight function works very well and is a nice addition for a survival phone (when camping, for example).The lens is not sealed but I doubt it will be cracked.UseThe menu system, because it's an international phone is not as intuitive.

The image quality when exported is actually quite respectable.Battery life is very good, especially if you don't use the backlit keys, screen and flashlight excessively.Sound quality is good for the caller and the recipient.  Once paired with the Bluetooth headset, the sound and reception are clear.The FM radio is a nice touch but only works with the plug-in headphones.

She was already making plans to sell it broken or switch to an old flip phone she had when I found this item.  We're pretty much broke, but I can definitely afford $5 if it fixes her phone since it will be very important with the fall semester starting soon.  I took my time, cleaned my desk very thoroughly before starting to minimize dust, put the screws in a small heavy tray off to the side of my well lit work area, and everything went great. Make sure you have a decent quality very very very tiny screwdriver set. If they are crappy they will strip the screws.  I actually found that the only tool I really needed was a very small flathead screwdriver, tweezers, and a blow drier. This allowed me to get all the screws out, gently pry the lcd frame from the bracket, scrape off old adhesive, apply the new one, and put everything back together.  To be 100% clear, this is the glass with the digitizer attached.  It arrived towards the end of the estimated arrival date. Both the front and the back of the glass, and the top and bottom of the back of the glass have protective film on them, make sure to remove them at the appropriate times.  Leave them on as long as possible to avoid dust contamination.  Compressed air could have been helpful, but I got all the dust out and it looks crystal clear. The adhesive was a little tricky in my opinion.  It looked like you were supposed to peel the small brown pieces of paper off of the larger yellow sheet with the adhesive on it, but the adhesive wanted to stay on the yellow sheet and not the brown. Start at an edge and go slowly, making sure you are pulling both the brown backing AND the adhesive off of the yellow sheet. This is seriously pretty easy to do, you just can't rush it.

The part that fits to my belt is really good, the outer case that fits the phone is ok but there is very poor retention of the phone in the holster.  The innovative retention mechanism is the lip of the holster is suppose to keep the phone from sliding out.  However, if you use this in a horizontal position, I feel quite comfortable that you will loose your phone.  It slides out with hardly any resistance. For me, having the phone vertical is not comfortable due to the length of the phone but fortunately it does rotate at degreed increments and seems to hold that position fairly well.  Even with the holster canted at a 45 angle, the phone has the potential to come out of the holster if I run or jump...not a good thing. I don't feel the item is defective in any way but just lacking in some design details. The materials and overall appearance of the item are quite acceptable but it's unfortunate that they didn't make provisions for a retention strap or something better to secure the phone.I will try to make some modifications and live with it until something better comes along but just wanted potential buyers to be aware of the loose fit and potential loss of your phone.REVISION: 5-12-10I have found that I can improve the retention qualities of this holster by applying some tape to the inside of the two opposing guide lugs.

Design seems to make me always grip it on the camera lens to clip to pocket4.

My reasoning was simple: After a couple days, I figured I would be trading in my DInc for the Droid X as soon as one became available (those dang backorders!). But each day I slowly, but surely began to like my Incredible more & more. Before long I began to seriouly consider keeping it instead of trading up (although in honesty, the ONLY thing the X has on the Incrdible is a larger screen and more memory out-of-the-box, otherwise they are comparable in EVERY way--oh, and the X doesn't have Sense UI, so tie goes to HTC. With the 2.2 update, it now had Mobile Hotspot capabilities as well as HD video, so all-in-all they are pretty darned equal).Wouldn't you know it, within an hour of deciding to keep my phone I somehow managed to drop it (the story of my life). Not far, mind you--but when you've paid as much for a phone as these things typically co$t--even with my upgrade--it's almost weird how time really DID seem to stand still for a moment as I watched it fall. It really burned me, too--especially since I am such a staunch supporter of buying protective cases. Well I wasted NO time after this. I immediately went out and got my silicone gel case. It fit perfectly (oh, and BTW mine is a clear-ish version). It looks good, several times people have mistaken it for an iPhone. What I really like is how it protects and yet doesn't add unnecessary thickness to an already very thin phone. Even WITH the case my phone is about as thin as my old BB Tour WITHOUT a case (if not thinner).As another reviewer noted, this particular type of case tends to attract lint, hair and all sorts of miniature items you manage to accumulate in your pockets--along with tiny crumbs you may accidentally set your phone on top of. Weird, but its like a mini swiffer mop. Now in all fairness, I found that the similar manufactured EXPENSIVE case I used to have for my BB Bold did the exact same thing. I believe that silicone cases in general (which are by far my personal favorite) tend to attract these types of items, so accept it and move on. My other minor complaint is that when trying to retrieve from my pocket, the rubberized surface tends to want to *stick* to the inside of my pockets, sometimes annoyingly so. But again, this is the nature of almost ALL silicone cases I have ever seen. Not much you can honestly do about it, really. Once again, accept it and, well, you get the idea.In short, if you are looking to protect YOUR investment (and after spending $200 bucks, why wouldn't you?) this particular case works, fits and actually even looks nice. I'll definitely buy another (eventually).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A-L-M-O-S-T perfect...", "unixReviewTime": 1284422400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2010"}

Fit and finish are good, the rubber case fits snugly around the phone.  Rubber case is a good thickness, enough to protect the phone but not too bulky at the same time.

All I/O ports on phone are easily accessible (other reviewers who state otherwise purchased a different case), case does not block any ports or openings on the phone.  Overall, very pleased with this case and with the price point.  HTC Incredible owners should put this case on their short list.Update 7/24/10:  After using this case for several months now, I am still happy with the fit of the case (fits snugly around phone still) and it has saved my phone from damage on many occasions already.  The one thing that has been a bit annoying though, is that the rubber gets snagged in many of my khaki pant pockets.  When you hold the case in your hand, it feels smooth, but for some reason when it comes into contact with cloth material, it gets snagged easily.

The first picture on the amazon product page for this cable has what looks like a generic connector that you plug into the iPhone/iPad. That's the type of connector that looks bigger (fatter?) than the slimmer connector that you see on the current real Apple cables. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the cable that I actually received had the connector that was just like the ones you see on the more current real Apple cables. See the picture that I posted at the top of this product's amazon page for the cable that I received.I bought this cable from amazon marketplace seller 'The OEM Shop' for under three dollars with free S&H.; I received the cable very quickly in five days. I do NOT work for 'The OEM Shop' or for Amazon, but I mention the name of the seller because very few people seem to mention the name of the amazon marketplace seller who they bought a product from in their reviews. These cables are \"generic\" and it is often difficult to tell which seller sold the product that the buyer is either complaining about or praising in a product review. Also, a lot of buyers don't seem to realize that they can select a particular seller and not just take whoever is the seller who may be appearing as the \"default\" seller on an amazon product page. I don't know what determines who is the \"default\" seller, but I'm guessing that Amazon comes first if Amazon has the product in their warehouse(s), but if not, then maybe the other sellers are possibly rotated as the \"default\" seller on the page, and so on and so forth. Anyways, I think it is worth mentioning who is the particular amazon marketplace seller is in a review - especially if the product is generic like this cable and if there are a lot of sellers who are selling the product via the one single amazon product page.Anyways, the cable that I bought is indeed a nice long six-foot cable. It looks like the real thing. And it was new. I was able to charge my iPhone and iPad by using this cable when connected to a charger plugged into the wall. And I was able to sync my iPhone and iPad with iTunes on my macbook. The cable was also able to charge my iPhone via the USB on my macbook. For my iPhone, I've tried charging with both a real official apple power adapter and also a generic power adapter - and both worked. (Of course, for my iPad, I had to use the 10w charger that came with my iPad because you can't use anything else when charging from an electrical outlet in the wall.) I will be using this nice long six-foot cable for whenever I want to charge my iPhone or iPad for like when I want to use my iPhone or iPad when I'm in bed or if I'm sitting elsewhere like at the kitchen table and if I want to save the battery for later. (I would be keeping the shorter original cable that came with my iPhone/iPad for use with my macbook for syncing the iPhone/iPad.)

The 1500mAh was consistent with the original according to the red sticker, so that was alright (contrary to some other batteries other customers received from various Amazon sellers when ordering this battery).The biggest problem I have is that it was listed as \"NEW\".  This battery is not NEW in any way.  The gold contacts on the battery are worn, so it's obvious this battery was heavily used at some point.  That is straight-up LYING to people and taking their money the whole time knowing they're scamming people.Last night she plugged in her phone before she went to bed using this battery, and this morning the battery didn't charge... at all.  She gave up on it, put the OEM battery back in her phone, and let me know what happened.I would have been irritated enough if it would have been for MY phone, but now it's 10X worse because it looks like I cheaped-out on it after I told her I was getting her a NEW second battery for it.In the end, Beast Deals lied in their description... twice.

I received both the same day, and tried them out, and this 395 is clearer to others and me than the M20. I like newer headsets that show the battery level on the iPhone, and the voice prompts when powering and connecting. (Well, sometimes I do, and other times, the voice gets in the way of answering a call, which I have read can be very annoying to some.Bottom line, I want the headset simply to connect and work consistently, and I can always pay attention to the battery level &#34;manually&#34;. I don't care about listening to music on a mono headset, and the A2DP and &#34;smart&#34; features tended to take over the phone's sounds, like keyboard clicks, incoming email sounds, etc., which I depend on. So an older-fashioned mono headset, that feels good all the time, without falling out or off my ear, and still sounds at least as good as the phone (a friend said the 395 actually sounded better than the iPhone 5!) is exactly what I need. The shame may be that as these older headsets disappear (not to mention $20, as opposed to $120 for some!!), I may have to compromise quality for frills.By the way, I tried the Plantronics Legend (twice) and the Motorola HX550, thinking a newer, fancier headset might be better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very clean on both ends; no frills, features, bells or whistles.", "unixReviewTime": 1366243200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2013"}

It's a bit annoying that I can't tap the button on the side to activate voice dialing on my phone, but this could also be a problem on my phone's side (although it worked fine with other headsets), so I'm willing to let it go.My other complaint is that the little rubber speaker enclosure is too large and will rub your ear and cause discomfort after about an hour on the phone.

The shape is intuitive and extremely snug when compared to the typical silicone design, which is still adequate and a little cheaper; however, this case is well worth the extra couple bucks. The rubber feels a little thicker and less flimsy. The indented sides (as seen in the photo) are textured for the sake of grip, the power/volume buttons are covered without jeopardizing their functionality, and the extended/smooth central region makes it quite well designed for staying put and not wobbling on flat surfaces.

I bought this Amzer case as a holdover (i.e. it was in stock and Prime-eligible) to protect my phone until my \"real\" case arrived.Immediately upon receiving this case I put it on my phone.  The fit and finish are pretty good for a sub-$10 case.  The case in no way interferes with the stand built into the back of the phone, which I was a little concerned with.  The case fits pretty snugly on the phone and offers protection to both the screen and the camera lens since it extends slightly beyond both.  I do wish that the fit was a little tighter (dust seems to find a way in behind the case), but I can't argue with the protection.I know the protection works because this weekend I dropped my phone from a decent height (around 5 feet) onto a tile floor.  The phone fell straight down on to the screen with a muffled thud.  I picked it up and wiped the screen off on my shirt, and noticed that there were no cracks in the screen.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed that I hadn't even scratched the screen.Bottom line is this -- do I think that this case is perfect?  The dust issue bothers me so I can't say yes.  Do I think that this case offers the protection advertised and is worth every cent?  Absolutely.  Whether you are purchasing the case for full time use or (like me) are purchasing it as a holdover until another arrives, I do not think you'll regret it.

Eventually we came down to two choices, the Seidio Innocase Active Case for HTC EVO 4G - Limited Edition because it look impressive and the reviews were great, and this case because it was cheap and looked like it was well built. Both came in around the same time and we compared them side by side, and to be honest this case is WAY better than the Seidio one. Even at more than half the price this AMZER case trumps the Seidio in flexibility, quality of build, overall feel, button accessibility, looks, well.. everything! Now my friend is returning his Seidio so he can get this case! When we first got the cases, the AMZER came in a plain looking package, while his came in some fancy shmancy packaging. I was beginning to think I had made a mistake, but once we had taken them out of the packaging it was pretty clear who had the winner.It isn't that the Seidio is a bad case, its just the protection just isn't the same. We tried drop tests on both of them and his sounded like a loud \"CRACK\" which made me cringe every time we dropped it from about 12 inches, while this one made a soft thud and obviously absorbed the blow much. much better. The buttons with the Seidio were difficult and uncomfortable to push, while the AMZER was smart and made the case a little bit softer where the buttons are which made for pressing them just as easy as if there was no case at all. The Siedio has a much less flexible material compared to the AMZER and is not comfortable in the hand at all, the AMZER feels like it is conforming to the curves of your hand every time you hold it and actually makes it much easier to hold thanks to the anti-slip grip that the Siedio does not have. Overall the AMZER trumps the Seidio in almost everything. The Seidio, however, is a winner when it comes to repelling dust. The AMZER does pick up a light amount of dirt/dust that is not very hard to remove but still can be an eyesore if not maintained. The Seidio seems to not pick up any dust.If I were to pick between the two, I would save my money and go with the AMZER for sure.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than the Seidio Limited Edition case", "unixReviewTime": 1279238400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2010"}

It looks really nice and is semi-transparent (you can see the HTC logo on the back through the case) which in my opinion is great. It fits it well and as some reviewers have mentioned it is not sticky or bulky. It does the basic job of protecting the back of your phone from scratches and even possibly drops from a small height. I would recommend getting some screen protectors along with this case in order to have both the front and the back of your phone.The only reason I'm giving this case 4 stars instead of 5, is that as someone mentioned the case does not have cutouts for the power and volume buttons, which makes it a bit harder to press these buttons. I ended up using some small scissors and carefully cutting the holes out myself, which was pretty easy. Now the case is great, I just wish it came like that!One last thing I don't like is that each time I take the case off it snaps off the battery cover which has to be taken out of the case separately.

I am completely satisfied with it.First of all, I found out the first weekend of owning my Incredible that the nature of the LCD screen coupled with the polarization of some sunglasses makes the screen appear completely black (as if it was off) when turned sideways (landscape). I was not a fan of this, as I always wear my sunglasses and I pretty much have to use the landscape keyboard to type. Well, this anti-glare screen protector took all of that away. The screen is still slightly dimmer, but definitely (and almost quite literally) a day and night difference!I had some trouble applying the first protector, and ended up ruining it as a result, but that was my fault for not being more careful to get all the dust/dirt off the first time. MAKE SURE you do this, as one little speck of dust will cause a bubble 10x as big around it. You do need to be very careful getting this on to not only avoid the bubbles but avoid other places it just won't lay down; in short, be careful when handling it and removing the cutouts for the indicator lights so as not to bend the protector at all, as it won't lay flat on the screen.As mentioned in other reviews, it has not affected the response of the touch screen in the slightest, and I don't really even notice that it is on the phone. The instructions said that there was a small plastic card to press the protector on and smooth out the bubbles, but mine didn't have the card. Not a huge deal, I just used a card from my wallet. Also, I ordered these at the same time as a case for my phone which had 2-day shipping, and this product arrived the day before that one, with standard! I will not hesitate to buy another set of these if needed, especially at this price!UPDATE 7/12: I'm just now moving on from the Incredible, but wanted to point out that this first 3-pack I bought when I first got the phone at the end of 2010 lasted me up until now, despite ruining the first screen as mentioned above.

There is a full circle cutout where the optical button is - the photos are ambiguous as to whether it's a full circle or separated at the bottom.It's not a bad deal for the price but there is a small issue with the quality that I've seen from other vendors of cheap screen protectors.There appears a sort of bubble around a small part of the circle cut area of the optical mouse/button that appears after installation.  I think it is caused by dull cutters that causes the material to bend out of shape a bit instead of being cleanly cut.  Then because the plastic is bent, it does not fit perfectly flat around those cut areas.This is a very minor flaw but something the thicker, more expensive screen covers avoid (Like the AT&T; vended ones for the iPhone which have a similar circle hole).Other than that, there's nothing remarkable about these protectors save for the price.

I have tried many other protectors, all of them were some kind of stretchable plastic! this one doesn't stretch.6- the protector is cut EXACTLY to the size of the HTC Desire glass screen. it covers it completely from edge to edge.7- It is unbelievably CLEAR plastic. Deserves the name Crystal Clear.8- Once i removed the top protector cover and first touched the phone screen, it had ZERO smoothness, in a way that the plastic was super clean that it is not slippery at all and the protector started to get awful smudges from my fingers! However once it got my skin grease on it (didn't take more than 2 minutes of use) it became so transparent that you barely see it is there and unbelievably smooth that your finger just glides.7- I have been using it for a week and so far extremely satisfied!Bottom line, I strongly recommend this screen protector for your HTC Desire phone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seriously, the BEST I have tried so far", "unixReviewTime": 1313107200, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2011"}

This is not because there is something wrong with the product, but putting a screen protector is quite difficult to achieve a perfect result.  Lint and dust are always a problem.I first cleaned the iPhone screen with an optical spray applied on a piece of cloth, and then gave several gusts of air from a compressed gas duster.  I was able to align the protector almost perfectly but I got several bubbles.  I repeated the process and almost got it the next time.  On the third attempt, I was satisfied after pushing the bubbles to the side.  Pushing the bubbles with the cardboard only works if there is no speck of dust or lint under the screen.The matte screen really helps with the glare; it is also less susceptible to fingerprints.  When my kids play with grease on their hands, I just wipe it off and cleans easily.What you get:3 matte/anti-glare screen protectors, small cloth, and a small piece of cardboard to push the bubbles out.

When I did charge it, I'd charge it overnight (8~hours) and use it until it was about dead again. It would last for days though, I am positive on that.*Not sure about if you're seeing this at the $27 price I am now, but I can honestly say I'd hold off on it for that price.

(Please add a comment if you come across anything@)TIP: If you don't want to get charged for Internet usage ever, call up AT&T;, get a Customer Service Agent and tell them you want to block all data/Internet access.

You can use this as a backup phone - make most of your calls from anywhere over the Internet (via wireless hotspot and iPod touch, smartphone with WiFi - e.g. most Android, iOS or Symbian phones.)  It's best to use with Google Voice ; my GV # is my main phone # that I give out.  If the 'net connection isn't on, this lets me know if anyone calls, or texts, and then I can take the call on this phone or on another device.  Texting from an iPad is a GREAT experience compared to any cellphone.Cell Phone:The phone very cheap and yet it is quite sturdy.  It's about the simplest phone you can buy. This phone just lets you make calls and send/receive text messages, plus a few tools like alarms and calculators. No headset jack, volume controls, camera, crash-prone operating system,  No time-sucking learning curve.Final Word:I generally don't use more than $25 per 3 months.

The idea of this product is to connect it to your keychain, and then use it as a phone leash and a speakerphone.  We didn't really need it for the leash/cell phone alarm function for when you walk away from your cell phone, but I was intrigued by the idea of having a speakerphone that connects to your keychain.  The description lists this device as a \"full functioned speakerphone\" but that is not really the case.This is my fourth cell phone blue tooth device, so I am familiar with pairing devices.  Even so, it still took me 45 minutes to get this device paired with my cell phone.  In any event, once I was able to pair the device, I connected it to my keychain and started testing it.  The ZOMM unit vibrates prior to ringing; I couldn't find a way to change that even though my phone is set to ring tones only.  This seems counterintuitive to a device that is marketed as a speakerphone.  This is an issue to because the vibrating first reduces the time you have to answer a call before it goes to voicemail.  Not a huge issue, but worth noting.  Once a call comes in you push the center buttom once, and now you can chat via the ZOMM unit.  The quality is obviously less than what you would expect with a headset, or a full sized speakerphone, but it is adequate,What I found surprising is when I tried placing a call with the ZOMM unit paired up and turned on.  My call would only go through my cell phone even though the ZOMM was on and paired.  I went to the website and did some research and it turns out that you must push the ZOMM button WHILE YOUR OUTGOING CALL IS RINGING to transfer the call to the ZOMM device.  Why is this function not automatic when the ZOMM is marketed as a full function speakerphone?  I have another bluetooth speakerphone, a Plantronics K100 Bluetooth Speakerphone, that clips to my car visor that handles both incoming and outgoing calls automatically - I don't need to \"route\" the outgoing call to the speakerphone, which seems to defeat the purpose of hands-free dialing, especially when the ZOMM is connected to the keychain hanging from my ignition.  I don't want to place my call, listen for the ring through my phone, then reach for the ZOMM at my keychain/ignition, all while driving.  The k100 sells for about 50% less than the ZOMM.  I would recommend it or any similar product over the ZOMM if your primary need for this product is a bluetooth speakerphone.The ZOMM is quite small, and comes with a belt clip and a keychain.  If you want a leash to help prevent you from losing your phone, and can live with diminished speakerphone functionality, I guess this product is OK.  But for what it costs, I can't really recommend it as a a good value.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Overpriced for what it does", "unixReviewTime": 1313280000, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2011"}

Ultimately, these annoyances were enough for her to hand it back to me.Also, when I think leash, I envision a tether that I can use to find the distant end, i.e. I expect to be notified that I have forgotten my phone and get some help finding it, similar to a keyring leash that helps me find my misplaced keys.I'm sure the speaker phone use might be useful to those without other bluetooth headsets or setups, but for me I cannot use this device without continuous attention.

I'm a tech junkie and love trying out new products. The ZOMM seemed like a cool idea - a \"leash\" for your phone so that when you misplace it, you'll be able to find it.  Couple that with a speakerphone and a panic button, and it seemed like a really good idea.Well, the idea is much better than the actual product. First of all, if you want to use this device, you need to have the bluetooth on your phone turned on at all times. For my phone (Droid Incredible), that cuts the battery life in roughly half. That makes it a major pain to use, as I always need to make sure I have my phone charger with me.The ZOMM works pretty simply - attach it to your keychain, connect it to your phone, and you're set. Walk about 30 feet away from your phone with your ZOMM, and it starts beeping very loudly (and I mean LOUD!). It also functions as a speakerphone. Just press the button on the ZOMM to answer a call and use it as a speakerphone. The quality is nice (great wind reducing technology), but the problem is that it's always connected to my keychain. So when I'm in the car, my keys are obviously in the ignition, which is like 4 feet away from my mouth. So people say they have a hard time hearing me because I'm so far away.It also functions as a panic button.  I tried it once, and it wasn't very loud (the newer versions being shipped now are roughly 4 decibels louder than the original models). It just didn't seem like a very useful feature to me.I know these devices are marketed at busy mothers, which is maybe why I didn't find it to be all that useful.

Neither is a particularly good thing and if you have the same issue then the ZOMM sounds like a godsend.It syncs with your phone via the bluetooth connection (which means you cannot use another blutooth device) and functions as a speakerphone while driving, alerts you if it is more than a certain distance from your cellphone, allows you to call 911 at the press of a button and emits an panic alarm if you need it to.I was able to sync the ZOMM to my phone with no problem at all. Changing the settings of my device (turning off the panic alarm which seemed just to easy to trigger in a crowded bag) was a little harder since I could not access the correct place on the website for a while.Biggest cons:This is no more than a bluetooth on a keychain. The speaker phone aspect when actually driving (which means the Zomm is swinging from your ignition) is not so good. Scratchy at best, indecipherable at worst.This thing needs to be charged regularly. Even more regularly than my phone. So, there have been plenty of times that I have waltzed out of the door sans phone since my ZOMM has run flat and so failed to function as a 'leash'. If it has a warning beep for when it needs charging, I have not heard it. Perhaps the next model needs a battery that holds a longer charge time??The price is way more than acceptable, in my mind, for something that promises much and delivers little.Pros:As a personal safety device, I suppose it replaces an Onstar system in case of an accident. Press a button and you can call 911 - as long as you have remembered to charge it, of course.It is tiny and light and clips on to your keychain without turning it into a monster mess.So, in my mind the pros do not stack up so well against the cons. My husband has a Jabra cruiser speakerphone in his car and it is a dream. You can get it on Amazon for just over $60.

Like the title of the product itself, it's a leash, so if you liken your intelligence to a canine who can't keep a thought together for more than two minutes, the Zomm will be your holy grail of electronics.  Ignoring that, though, and focusing on the product itself, it does exactly what it says.The device beeps when you are at least 30 feet away from your items in the event you should drive away and forget.  It also acts as a speakerphone, so if you leave your phone in another room while at home it would prove useful in this way.  The speakerphone function is probably the best feature as the sound is pretty clear when used.  The bluetooth functionality works fine, but make sure you check the abilities of your phone as it must be able to handle multiple bluetooth accounts at a time.  The belt clip it comes with seems to work fine, and it's not too intrusive.While it does all of these things, it also proves to be useless and cumbersome in several ways.  Firstly, this thing isn't small.  The image you see here on Amazon's page is scaled to its actual size.  So if you plan on cramming this on to your keyring, forget it.  It's as thick as five or six keys as well, so unless you enjoy walking around with a bulge in your pants (I'm sure many men wouldn't mind) it's just too bulky.  Also, this thing will need to be charged everyday.  It seems to die in a heartbeat, and it goes off indiscriminately at times.  Perhaps I received a defective product, but it will just randomly beep when the phone is literally two feet away, thus draining the battery.  I'm guessing that the people who are distracted enough to forget their phones on a regular basis are the ones who will want this thing, and those people aren't going to remember to charge items when they need charging.This is one of those products that will only speak to the right type of person.  Personally, this Zomm Wireless Leash is absolutely worthless to me.  Then again, I'm a thinker, and I don't forget important items when I leave home.  Additionally, I don't see a lot of purpose in this device.

(see Cons)Cons:Battery life only lasts about two days (max). If you're the type that always forgets your phone in places, hopefully you're better at remembering to keep things charged.If your phone doesn't support multiple BT devices and if you also use a BT headset, the Zomm won't be able to work with your phone too. Fortunately, many (most?) modern phones support multiple connections. You should check yours before purchasing though.The panic alarm function works and is loud but if you have to hold down the main button for a long time. If you're in an emergency and have enough time to wait then you're probably not in a real emergency.______________________________________________Some other customers said that they had problems with the Zomm going off even if it was in their pocket and only separated by their body. I did not experience this. Perhaps it has to do with the strengths of the phone's BT signal?Unfortunately, I have not had the need to really test the speakerphone feature. It worked well enough in a quiet room but I haven't had a chance to test it in a vehicle.As I mentioned earlier, the alarm is loud and annoying and abrupt. I wish it had a graduated volume that increased every few seconds.If you leave separate your phone and the Zomm intentionally, a simple press of the Zomm's button mutes it until it detects your phone again. Since my keys and phone rarely are separated this is nice for me. If you are constantly finding your keys in one place and your phone in another, it might become too much of a habit to just mute the alarm when you really have forgotton your phone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does what it says but is it what you need?", "unixReviewTime": 1311120000, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2011"}

Speakerphone is decent for the size of the device and could use it my car as a speakerphone.However it does not trigger voice commands via Bluetooth on my android ver. 2.2 device or my iPhone device so you cannot use it to make voice activate calls from the Zomm. Some phones will allow multiple pairings of BT devices but not simultaneously connections of identical profiles without actively switching between the Zomm and your BT headset in the phone's menu system.  So, Zomm really needs to make this device capable of initiating calls via bluetooth if you cannot use a BT headset simultaneously.I also found that many times if I chose to use the device a speakerphone particularly on a call I initiated it would frequently drop connection with my phone and I would have to reconnect by making a single depress of the Zomm button.  Generally after two BT connection drops the Zomm would then stay active during the call, however the individual on the other end maybe irritated with you by then.I rating this device 2 stars because it has some quirks that make it difficulty to adopt usage consistently.

I wanted this device to shift from the gadget role into something handy and more mainstream, but it falls short. I'll talk about the good first. The \"leash\" role works pretty well. If you walk away from your phone, it goes off and it's a pretty loud sound too. It was fairly easy to setup on the computer and connecting to my phone which is an LG banter touch.Now onto some of the issues. The first is it sucks as a portable speaker/headset. People can hardly hear me, and I can't really hear them either. It's just awful in this area so this dual role is pretty much useless. It has a habit of setting off the alarm multiple times even after I basically told it to stop which brings us to the next part of the problem, it's one button design. It just doesn't work. Maybe after a year of solid use, using the push once in this situation and push twice in that situation will become second nature to me, but for me, this device is not meant to be used that often because, as I said above, the headset functionality is terrible. They should have just added another small button or two and just simplified the process. Another problem is the battery life. I don't know if it ever does anything besides stop \"beating\" when the battery is dead. You can glance down and check the lighted \"N\" to see if it is connected and working with the phone, but during a busy day or even week, I'll forget to look. When I do look, it's dead. I have no idea how long it's been dead, but the battery life seems pretty poor.I think this was an interesting idea, especially the leash part which works okay, but it falls short for the mainstream crowd and is really only something I think the gadget persona is going to love.

I ordered this case from a different website since it was not available for a long time on Amazon.  First of all this case is not a typical rubbery/silicon case as you might expect.  This is a more durable, less flexible type of harder rubber.  It does not have the same feel or flexibility as the Amzer silicon case which I also have.  The Argyle case is more of a smooth, harder rubber as it does not have any texture to it.  I do not find it slippery at all though so no worries there.  There is a cutout for the headphone port, the micro-hdmi port, the micro-usb port, the camera/speaker/flash and the kickstand.There are not cutouts for the power button or the volume rocker buttons but it is very easy to press the buttons anyway as there are elevated areas on the case to help in pushing those buttons.  This case is slimmer than the Amzer silicone case and it does not come over the front of the display as much.  Whether this is good or bad is a total personal preference.  I do not think this cover would provide as much protection as a true silicon case in case of a drop, but I have not tested this and do not plan too!  The silicon cases are thicker and thus I feel would provide protection.  That being said this is a good compromise between protection and thickness.  I currently have switched from the Amzer silicone case to this one.  It's not that the silicone case is not good, it is excellent.  It is just a personal preference as to the look of the case and the fact that it is a little slimmer than the silicone case.

I prefer this version much better. My wife has the White Evo and I have the Black version.On the black Evo:The Clear argyle case has a much more pronounced Argyle pattern in the back of the device, which looks cool. The Smoke Grey version (i.e the one being reviewed) shows a very light pattern on the back of the Evo, since its a dark case, but it still good. If you're buying the case mainly for the pattern, go for the clear version, but if you're looking for an understated case that doesn't scream 'I'm a case!', go with smoke grey. I personally prefer smoke grey since the clear version adds a whitish border to the front of the Black Evo which I'm not too fond of.On the white Evo:I'm not a big fan of the White evo per se since it appears to be a half-baked attempt. The front of the Evo looks black and the back white. But the Smoke grey case makes the white Evo look really good! It gives the back a very nice shade of dark greenish brown with a prominent argyle pattern on it. The clear version is also an improvement to the phone alone, since its brings the whiteness of the phone to the front as well. The clear version's argyle pattern is barely noticeable on the white Evo.Criteria other than looks:Pros:1. The case is made of very good material. Its not sticky like the silicone cases and therefore does not attract lint or stick to your pocket insides.2. Despite the above, it gives a good grip to the device.3. The thickness is just right to ensure the camera does not make contact with your table.4. Its transparent enough that the HTC logo is visible from the back.5. Easy to slip on to the phoneCons:1. Crash protection is probably not as good as silicone cases since it doesn't compress much, but the other advantages still make it a better choice in my opinion.2. Easy to slip on to the phone, but definitely adds a light twisting pressure to the phone when removing. Not recommended for people planning to swap batteries often.3.

Or you may spend a lot of time in an area without 4G service. Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in other areas can diminish your overall user experience.Don't move to a smart phone without some research into these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who can offer me the best service, or the best combination of value and service. The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution...Bottom line for the HTC EVO 4G: feature loaded, user-friendly and a hard choice to go wrong with in a crowded smart phone market.The phone ships with an impressive array of capability and apps, and finding and installing new ones from the Android marketplace is easy even for non-techies.Two very strong performers in the pre-installed applications are Google-powered Voice Search and Navigate: both are eerily good at delivering search results and driving/walking directions. This phone's voice-to-text interface is also very good, and can be used for both composing text messages and delivering search results without typing. Surprisingly, a voice-based dialing app that is part of the operating system's collection of widgets seldom gets one right. The Evo's on-screen keyboard is adaptive to your compositions over time, and will suggest auto-completes for words you frequently type.The phone includes two cameras: an outward facing high resolution (8 megapixel) still/video camera, and a front facing 1.3 megapixel camera for video applications. It ships with an 8 GB microSD card. One surprising oversight of this phone is the placement of the microSD card inside the battery compartment. Although you can move files to an from it via the USB port, this phone would be improved if the card were accessible without removing the back cover.In addition to the USB port, the phone has a 3.5mm aux audio jack and an HDMI port.The rear of the phone includes a \"kickstand\", allowing you to stand the phone on a horizontal surface when viewing the display in landscape mode (great for using the speakerphone or watching videos).Customization of the scrolling display screens is intuitive. In our house, even less technically savvy users were re-arranging icons and applications in no time.Each of phone, video and still image quality are satisfactory.The overall finish of this phone is --literally-- quite slick. It can go sliding easily on leather car seat, and both the screen and frame will attract and display fingerprints. Whether or not you opted in to the damage/loss insurance that most providers offer, I'd strongly recommend both a screen protector and some case or holster to offer a modicum of protection to the phone.Mnay options exist for protection, but for our multiple Evo phones we've found the following to provide a good mix of protection and price:--\"Fishbone\" protective case (red linked here; other colors are available)--SGP STEINHEIL Anti FingerprintSprint Screen Protector (Anti Fingerprint)Let these protective devices soak up the wear and tear instead of your phone and display.Other reviews have discussed battery life, and it's worth addressing. This phone has five separate radio transmit/receive devices:-the standard cellular (3G/CDMA) transceiver-the 4G transceiver-Bluetooth (for short-range use of hands-free devices and data exchange)-GPS receiver-Wifi transceiverEach of these devices will exert its own demand on the battery. Selectively turning them off when not needed, along with setting a shorter time to turn off the display (2 minutes or 1 minute) will go a long way to mitigate the battery issue. Additionally, there are extended life aftermarket batteries (usually with an accompanying modified case cover to accommodate their their additional bulk) that will easily get you through your work day away from external power.A note about apps:Android is a Google operating system, and access to the Android marketplace for additional apps requires entry through a Google/Gmail account (either existing or one you create when setting up the phone). In return for the apps, be aware that you surrender significant personal information on your phone, your location (at minumum the nearest cell tower, and in some cases your GPS-derived location) and details of how you used the phone and applications. Providing this information is the cost of admission for functionality of the apps. I'm not offering a value judgement on this...just pointing it out for your information.Finally, a note about pricing:Comparison shop and pay attention when you're ready to make the move to a smart phone. For the hardware purchase, you can expect to find considerable differences in the prices (even when upgrade discount and rebates are included) from different vendors. Be sure to check out each each of your provider's \"store\" (brick and mortar, by phone and online), big box stores and even Amazon's new wireless store. It's worth investing a couple minutes in this research to save a considerable amount on the purchase price.Becoming a smart phone user begins with shopping smartly!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not quite perfect, but a great choice in a crowded smart phone market...", "unixReviewTime": 1297900800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2011"}

How can this op system be behind Palm in so many ways (vs. Palm 10 years ago, no less?) and simple exercises such as deleting e-mail messages take SO MUCH LONGER than on a Blackberry?  Ridiculous. I'm learning that transitioning to ANYTHING after being a Palm Power User is a tough thing. My assessments:POSITIVES1.  Great internet device - much better than my Palm or BB.  I have been able to do online surfing, purchasing from Amazon, Groupon, etc. with no issues.2.  HTC Sense is ok - Once you get the hang of HTC Sense (the basic home screen system), it is not too bad finding contacts and dialing frequently used #'s and setting up .  I agree with other reviews that the contact search function doesn't work very well, though.3.  Lots of free apps out there - Good thing about Android is the application base is improving4. My favorite thing so far: Downloaded Graffiti (just like Palm's original) and WAY better than the HTC Evo keyboard. I actually love the Graffiti because it is the original that Palm offered (before that piece of junk they called Graffiti 2).5.  Games :)NEGATIVES1.  Worse than Palm 5x (released in 2000 or so) for Datebook/Contact/To Do/Memos! - Doesn't do the basics of datebook/addresses/to-do's/memo's-notes as well as my Palm did 10 years ago. Web opinion on this is universal agreement.  Sigh.2. Voice dialing is the worst I have EVER used3. The OS is NOT intuitive and simple. , and Android 2.2 is here and better, but still a long way to go.4.  Was really tough to move Palm data over! - Got address book to move over via a user developed PERL script. Ridiculous that someone had to write one. Otherwise, you lose several address book fields  Am doing Memos via Notes Everything. Works ok but still not Palm simple.  Am doing To-do's via my work Blackberry - don't like any of the Android task managers.  Wish they had a better task manager built into Gmail and not one that interacts with the datebook calendar.5.  Terrible keyboard - thank goodness for Graffiti.6.  Camera is fuzzy - friends with iPhones get much better pictures.7.  Terrible battery life - Never had a device that lasts for so little time.  And I have to be careful not to let it run out completely, because I have had it completely reset twice in that situation (and had to resync and reload programs).8.  Webcam doesn't work - the native appilcation as well as downloadable third party ones do not work.  They freeze, stutter, and are not Skype compatible.9.  Drag down feature to answer phone hangs up - wish there was a work around like pushing a button on the device.SUMMARY: I'm starting to cope :) but could be so much better.  Good news is that Android open platform invites lots of competition and continuous improvement.  Let's hope that they continue to improve and that I can replace it with a MUCH BETTER phone in a year or two.--------------------------------UPDATE January 2011I like my Android MUCH MUCH Better than I did at first... To be clear, it is not the most user friendly device, so I have had to either figure workarounds or learn things about how to do things on the phone that were not obvious at first1.  Between Swype (handwriting recognition like on a Palm) and Smart Keyboard (available on Android Market), I have found much better ways to input data - far faster than the base program.2.  Voice Recognition - I now dictate memos, emails etc. which is even faster than Swype, and in Smart Keyboard it gives you multiple options about what you said, and one is almost always right.  Love it!!!3.  Small shortcuts/workarounds - Each Android user interface is a little different, and HTC sense has turned out to be ok.  Things like speed dial buttons have a lot of weird things to them (tap on the picture to speed dial, tap on the name right below it - a tiny sliver of a spot - to see the whole contact) that I figure out by trial and error.  It is a little annoying that the explanations of these short cuts aren't more easy to find or more intuitive.  Never struggled to find how to do them on my BB (the Apple/Window style drop down menus clearly tell you what to do).4.  GPS - I use the built in Google Navigation/Maps, and it rocks.  But again, not totally intuitive, and a few extra keystrokes.  But now that i understand how to use it, it is AWESOME!  I use the GPS ALL The time.5.

I upgraded my Moment to the HTC EVO, because I was tired of having to constantly reboot my phone, due to the radio lockup issues with it (Samsung build quality stinks also).I have to say, that HTC got it right with this phone. It's simply awesome. It's fast, it feels solid, and has a nice big screen. The one downside to this phone is that it (just like any real smartphone) is a battery hog. I can get the phone to last an entire workday with minimal usage (turning off 4G, Wifi, a few texts and a few short calls), however I just bought the 1800 maH extended battery set, and will try it out in that. Hopefully it will give me a few more hours. Sprint did just release a 2600 maH extended battery (an official one) but I've invested a lot in cases, and don't want that investment to go to waste, so I bought a slim extended battery instead.Aside from the battery life, I have absolutely NOTHING negative to say about this phone. It just works. It's fast, smooth, and never drops a call. Thanks to the Instinkt, I was certain I couldn't live without a slideout QWERTY, but the EVO has changed my mind. The onscreen keyboard is very responsive and accurate (thanks to the big screen), and it also includes SWYPE (which is really neat to use as well). It comes with an included 8GB Micro-SD card, so you will have plenty of storage. It has a really convenient kick-stand on the back, for viewing videos. Another awesome thing? This phone is insanely easy to root (unrEVOked 3), and get the sprint bloatware off of it.If you have the chance, GET THIS PHONE! You won't regret it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best. Smartphone.

{"reviewerID": "A27WPJ5JYEZPPK", "asin": "B003N9B3CY", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [70, 78], "reviewText": "Lets get this out of the way - I had the iPhone 3GS for 10 months (jailbroke it 4 months). The service with AT&T; was just fine other than the dropped calls here and there which I believe is with every network. The 3G connection was good here in Vegas. Now, I decided to switch from the iPhone to the EVO 4G because once I saw the screen (I didnt realize I wanted a bigger screen) it was a definite plus. Much like any phone available there are things that this does better and could do better. Now mine review will be a bit of a comparison to the iPhone since that was what I just left.Battery Life: I could make it through the whole day with the iPhone obviously depending on usage and which features were turned off or on. Generally I would have to turn off 3G to do so. On the EVO 4G for example - this morning it was at 100% at 5am it is now 9:36am and I am just under 50% with light usage (4G is turned off) 3G only and screen brightness at auto. A bit too early from me to determine true battery usage without some more time but first impression I would say it has OK battery life and the iPhone is good.Screen: To me there is no comparison between the two screens. iPhone has a 3.5 and the EVO 4G has a 4.3 - thats just more landscape to view anything. Now, in sunlight the iPhone does outshine the EVO. Its just easier to see. The EVO screen is just more vibrant and sharper to me than the iPhone.Touch Response: This is a neutral category. I don't see either one being more responsive than the other.OS: Well, this one is a bit trickier I believe. The OS on the iPhone is quite polished and it does things very well. Its responsive and has nice built in feature for email contacts. The EVO on the other hand has a very nice OS in Android 2.1- its more customizable in how you want to personalize your phone. Features that the iPhone 4.0 OS will bring as already here. Folders and custom background are in. Not to mention and by far the greatest feature of them all....NO ITUNES. Not needed for activation, for music or video. I like the Amazon MP3 service better. Actual MP3's. Android is loaded with tons of features to let you change your own experience with the phone. Its like giving you power of your own device.Camera and Video: Not tested.Talk: With my usage nothing that I would say is any different from AT&T; to Sprint here in Vegas.4G: Connectivity is spotty at times with my testing here in Vegas but when its on its fast. Way faster than 3G.... noticeably. Surfing on the EVO is like being freed from not being able to see webpages the way they are suppose to. I do have to state however that certain pages heavy on Flash can cause a slow down. For example the [...] website can be cumbersome to navigate (but on the iPhone as well).Connectivity: I have not had any problems with Bluetooth at all. It connected to my bluetooth stereo and ear piece without a hitch.Multitasking: So far I have had a bluetooth connection going, playing music and surfing the internet and there was no slowdown on the phone at all.Overall I have to say that I am very pleased with the EVO 4G in my 4 days of ownership. I like the iPhone but disliked iTunes very much and the fact I could not do simple things such as folders and custom backgrounds. I understand that it is coming in 4.0 but thats too little too late. Not to mention that my bill goes from $105 to $85 after taxes. It is a bit unfair for those not in a 4G City to have to pay for the service but for me it would still be cheaper than AT&T; without 4G. The cost itself is better for me. The phone to me does everything the iPhone can do and then some (even better). Two things that stand out is the email and webpages on the EVO. Those two along are ahead of the iPhone. The iPhone does have the cool letters on the right hand side for contacts that the EVO lacks but the with the EVO you can send certain numbers directly to voice mail. For every person its going to be a to each there own type of decision. With the next iPhone information being released this week time will tell how well the EVO hold up in the competition but as for me Im glad I switched.UPDATE 6/8/2010 - All is fair in love and war....so they say. Anyways, I had issues with the iPhone along the way such as lock ups, apps just closing, not turning on. So now its the EVO's turn: using speaker phone I was on hold, the screen turns blacks as normal for power save however I could not get the picture to come back. I could hear the hold music but pushing any buttons did not return the screen back so I had to remove the battery. The weirder one is for whatever reason last night 3G somehow got turned off. Not sure how but it did.UPDATE 6/10/2010 - Ok, so everybody has heard the old saying \"dont quite your day job\" well that kinda of apply s to the camera and video abilities. Like most smart phones I wouldnt say people use them as the primary means for taking pictures and video but its nice to have the function built in. The video and pictures are ok and can be good depending on the scene. Since this standard is not going anywhere maybe a future version will improve on this.Battery life still depends on usage but for light usage you can make it a whole day without charging with 4G turned off. Medium to Heavy with 4G turned off might last you half a day.UPDATE 6/14/2010 - More news update; random applications such email, internet and sprint tv will error out and force close. It might take a few attempts but it will eventually work. Games from my experience on Android for the most part are not as polished as those on the iPhone. They seem a bit.....old. I have only downloaded and tested a few (free). Internet sharing with the PC (Windows Vista & 7) is pretty easy. Might take a few minutes to set up but then you are good to go. 4G still seems very spotty here in Vegas for a good connection so I dont get to see fast 4G speeds all the time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My Take", "unixReviewTime": 1275868800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2010"}

I've had the EVO for a week now, and I'm very happy to say it hasn't re-booted itself. So I'm happy with that. It's larger than I expected, but that ok. It feels good while holding it, and looks even better. The calls are clear and my people can hear me just fine.I'm not to happy with the calendar on it. It doesn't let me do some things my Blackberry did, but I can and will live it. It's way faster than my Blackberry was when it comes to opening up web pages.

It has so many features and capabilities that it would be hard to cover them all in an Amazon review, so I'll just touch on a few good and bad points that were important to me. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Mobile Hot-Spot; we picked this up as an \"extra\" line on our account almost solely for the \"Mobile Hot-Spot\" capability. We live on top of a mountain in South-Central PA and even though we do get Internet through our cable modem it is very unstable and goes out intermittently for hours or even days at a time. Since I work from home full time, Internet access is a necessity so when it goes out I have to drive off of the mountain to my wife's shop and work from there, not to mention that my wife and kids complain something fierce when their PCs and the XBox can't connect to the Internet.

The cable is not included so I boughtAmzer Micro HDMI High Speed Male to HDMI Male Cable for HTC EVO 4G (5 Feet).

I have nothing against ATT, but they do not have very good service in my area.  If the IPhone would have been offered on Sprint, it would have been a no brainer.  But, since it wasn't, I considered switching to the HTC EVO.  It is the first phone that I thought might be good enough to let me switch back to Sprint, which has much better coverage in my area.  I went back and forth for weeks, and finally decided to try the EVO for 30 days.  Now I LOVE this phone too!  It's not better than the IPhone.....It's different.  So, for all of you IPhone users who are trying to decide what to do, I suggest you give it a try.  We went from a 2 IPhone family to a 2 EVO family and are happy.  The Android market has most of the apps that I actually used on my IPhone.  My husband is not really gadget oriented, so he just leaves the phone pretty much as it is.  I am just a little bit \"techy\" and I love all the customization I can do to it.  I wasn't sure I could adjust to the bigger size, but I love the screen.  Now when I try to use my IPhone, it seems way too small.  I was a little bit worried about the battery life at first, but it hasn't been a problem.  It makes it through the day (and I actually use it more than I did my IPhone), and I just charge it every night (which is what I did with my IPhone).  I bought a few extra charging cords for just in case (I got the Blackberry Micro USB cords for $1.99 on Amazon and they plug into my Apple USB chargers).  I was going to buy an extra battery (nice option), but I don't think I need one. I do miss all of the accessories available for the IPhone, but in reality, I bought a few items and that was it.  What I don't miss about the IPhone is the dropped calls and no service areas.  I can now go anywhere in my town and actually make and receive phone calls....and it costs less.  Now if Sprint did eventually get the IPhone, I'm not sure I would switch back to it.

It all started with my palm pilot years ago, which I loved. This phone is far and away the best tech device I have ever owned. I am also an iPhone owner, 2G and 3GS.I can't speak about the iPhone 4, but this phone is way better than the iPhone 2G/3G versions. It's not necessarily the fault of at&t; either. While I had to leave my iPhone / at&t; due to horrible coverage in the SF Bay Area, the iPhone itself had its issues. Wi Fi performance on my EVO is unbelievably fast compared to my iPhones. well in general, the iPhone was really slow, had poor 3G performance and would hang all the time. When I wanted to enter data on the keyboard, the iPhone would stall and i couldn't enter data. But this is an EVO review.This phone is FAST. There is 0 waiting for apps to run, enter data, scroll through menus, it's instant and the way it should be.My coverage in the SF Bay area is amazing compared to iPhone/at&t.; I never drop calls and get cell service on BART from Walnut creek all the way to San Francisco. Only when BART passes throug the caldecott do I lose reception. with my iphone it would take forever to regain reception when coming out of a no reception area, and there were plenty. The EVO is up and transmitting data right away.The video is awesome. You really have to think twice about needing to use a camera or camcorder. I recently hiked  to the top of a mountain near walnut creek and did a 360 deg video of the view. i then played it on my 52\" Sony flatscreen via the optional HDMI cable. It wasn't a news quality broadcast, but it was amazing to think my cell phone tool that video.I love the android operating system. It's got more options than an iPhone, but I am OK with the tradeoff between the EVO's ability to be more customizable vs. the iPhones simplicity. To be honest, I think that apple has dumbed down its operating system so even the most tech disabled people will be comfortable with it. Android has widgets which if you have a mac computer you will be familar with. Ironically the iPhone does not have them. The EVO also has this pinch function when you are in the home screen which is similar to the function when you squeeze the mouse on a mac. All the open pages are visible and you can quickly pick one.I love the new message notification screen. Just swipe your finger down the homecreen when you see notification icon and all your new emails, texts, and phone calls are summarized. Just tap one when and you go straight there. easy and fast.I am an exchange user and have a personal gmail account. No big news here. EVO sets up and syncs effortlessly. My big gripe though. Neither the iPhone or the EVO sync outlook notes or tasks without convoluted unreliable workarounds. I am not willing to install all the goofy 3rd party solutions for either phone. But I do use tasks with my google account and the EVO does sync no problem with my google tasks.There is much concern about battery life. My OEM battery lasted about the same as my iPhone 3GS, til about 3PM. Then done. But I bought this extended battery [...] for $41 and I am done worrying about battery life and have a spare fully charged battery now as a backup. Not an option with an iPhone. At 3Pm now I still have 50% battery available.SD card. The stock phone comes with an 8GB micro SD card thats not particularly fast. I upgraded to a class 6 16GB card for $71 and it was a big improvement. This card is super fast at file transfers. [...]  This fast card will also improve the video performance of the HD video ability of this phone. There has been choppiness complaints about the video quality with the stock micro SD card, but none with the class 6.I was a little hesitant about the size of this phone at first, and wanted an HTC droid incredible instead. The droid incredible is the same size as an iphone which I was comfortable with. But I am glad the droid incredible wait list was so long. The size of this phone is just fine. And now in fact my iPhone seems kind of small. I do need reading glasses so the size of this phone, being just a little bigger is no problem and an east tradeoff.If you think my iPhones were just bad ones. You're right, they were. My 2G was replaced under warranty once. The second 2G is actually a pretty good phone. Stable and a pretty fast OS. My wife uses it and loves it. My 3GS is bad. I am on my 3rd one. The first two had the hot battery problem and were replaced by apple. My 3rd one does not get a hot battery, but it is SLOW. I mean really slow. I gave it to my 17 YO daughter and I will probably have to bring it back to apple and go for number 4. Even she is struggling with it. Thank god I got the extended warranty.This phone is awesome, and by far the best I have ever owned. And I have owned a few. All the palm treos, which I liked, except when I made a brief jump to Verizon and they only had a treo with windows mobile. That was a buggy phone.

Unlike my last four HTC smartphones (PPC6700, PPC6800, Touch Pro, Touch Pro 2), I can read without squinting!The Android Operating System puts Windows Mobile 6 (or whatever they are calling it these days) to shame.The 1 Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor is blazingly fast. Multitasking is quick and efficient.Available RAM is a bit on the chintzy side.There's a lot of bloatware installed on the system, but that is easily gotten rid of. You have to be extremely careful with setting options since, as delivered, the Evo 4G will suck your battery dry within a few hours of just sitting there and seemingly doing nothing. In my early days of experimentation, I went from 100% charge when I went to bed to 15% by morning. This is one device where you really want to learn all you can about it. Read the manual, delve deeply into the settings and follow the forums. When people talk about poor battery life on this phone, they're being honest but also exposing their ignorance or unwillingness to optimize the battery life. My suggestion to Sprint, HTC and Google would be to deliver the Evo 4G with all the battery sucking options turned off and thus avoid the unnecessary bad rap about battery life.I have never been a fan of onscreen keyboards - until now. The onscreen keyboard on the Evo is great. It took me a little while to gain accuracy and speed, but I am now as fast if not faster than with the slider keyboards on my earlier HTC smartphones. One of the first purchases I made to complement the Evo is the Freedom Pro Bluetooth keyboard. (You also have to buy drivers for it from Google's Market service.) Couple that with any of several notes applications, email or QuickOffice and you can leave your laptop at home on many occasions. By the way, the Evo will support the new 32GB microSDHC cards.The Evo, with an optional Sprint service, can serve as a WiFi access point for up to eight other devices. The service while seemingly pricey is half the cost of Sprint's standalone data service. Sprint levies a $10 surcharge on monthly usage fees for the Evo. Allegedly this is to cover truly unlimited data service on 4G networks. The problem I'v encountered is that Sprint's 4G service in Chicago is spotty and practically impossible to obtain indoors. When you can get 4G, It can be blazingly fast - but it can often also be no better than a good 3G connection as well. To date, I am not overly impressed with 4G in terms of actual availability.Evo has two cameras. The rear-facing one is typical of higher end cell phone cameras. Usable, but not great, pictures. The twin LED flash helps a lot. The front-facing camera can be used with the Qik service for video calls. So far I am not impressed with Qik and the fact that are adding a surcharge for \"premium\" features which, in my opinion, shouldn't be considered premium doesn't help. Fring allows you to use Skype and Skype itself has promised an Android client this year.There are many cool things about this phone. It is, in my opinion, physically beautiful. I like the large size and it fits my hand well. The Android OS, so far, has been dependable with no system crashes. An occasional application crash, but not the OS itself. The four capacitive buttons on the bottom work more often than not. The volume controls on the right side are a design error in my view, but they work well enough.The HTC Sense User Interface, which I had turned off on my HTC Touch Pro and Touch Pro 2 smartphones has finally reached a level of maturity where it adds to the convenience of using the device.Call quality has been quite acceptable.Many tasks that can drive you mad on other phones are simple on the Evo. Finding and connecting with new WiFi and Bluetooth devices is as simple as it can get.That said, the WiFi  and phone receivers on the Evo seem exceptionally poor. I lose the WiFi signal in my unit, something that does not occur with my other phones or computers. Likewise my Sprint signal is far weaker indoors than with any of my previous Sprint HTC phones. This may, in fact, turn out to be a dealbreaker for me. Having had the unit for a week now, I have eliminated all the other possibilities for the poor reception - it is the Evo at fault here and I will be communicating with Sprint this next week to learn what they intend to do about the problem. The forums have been filled with complaints about these issues and, if my experience is a guide, with good reason.Google's Android Market offers a broad array of software, much of it useful. I have downloaded a number of programs, free and paid, and found them useful.A couple of little blessings: a kickstand on the back so you can conveniently watch videos or listen to music or books and a 3.5mm headphone jack.Overall this is an incredible piece of work. With my Bluetooth external keyboard, I can see myself leaving the laptop at home on many occasions. The Evo, so far, handles all my basic tasks smoothly, quickly and efficiently.You have to really learn about this device in order to manage power consumption - otherwise your battery life will be abysmal. And many, including myself, are unhappy with what might be weak WiFi and cell receivers or may be a firmware problem. I am hoping that the problem can be resolved soon.Sprint, HTC and Google have done a real number on the Sprint HTC Evo 4G. It is outstanding, a true engineering masterpiece. All the power you need for your everyday work tasks and communication fitted into the palm of your hand. On top of that, it is a great entertainment center as well, the 4.3\" screen being more than adequate for watching most movies and video.

It took them 4 hours to activate my phone and the data was activated by Sprint customer support over the phone sometime around 7PM that evening. It was a tough day for me (thanks to all you android fanboys), especially because I had been waiting to switch to android since almost one year. The reason it took me so long to switch was that all the available android phones were not necessarily better than the iPhone in my opinion. I wanted to move to android partly because it is Google's product and hence all other Google service that I use (gmail, search, picasa, docs, calendar, news, reader) come tightly integrated into all android phones. And the other reason was that I wanted to move away from the iPhone because I was tired of 3.5\" screen, I wanted a bigger yet pockatable screen... enter HTC EVO 4G with 4.2\" screen... I'm now a very happy boy!SCREEN: The bigger screen makes a huge difference. iPhone has a 3.5\" screen and EVO has a 4.2\" screen. If you consider the screen area, EVO's screen is ~45% larger. This significantly improves the web browsing and gaming experience. If you ever played a Sony PSP, then you already know how big EVO's screen is. Yup, it is exactly the same size as a Sony PSP although with much higher resolution. So an HTC EVO 4G will give you a screen that is ~45% larger than an iPhone in a not much bigger phone. In fact, this phone is almost the same size as my iPhone 3G enclosed in it's hard igriffin case!BATTERY: Is EVO's battery life comparable to other smart phones'? Yes.After disabling the 4G antenna, I can easily last through the day with my regular web browsing + gaming + phoning activities. The 4G antenna does require a lot of battery juice though. I don't live in a 4G area so I have no need for enabling the antenna, but if you do live in a 4G covered area... the easiest workaround would be to carry your charger (EVO comes with a wall+usb charger) or to use 4G only when you absolutely need it like uploading an 8 megapixel photo to Flickr. There are a ton of articles online about how to tweak EVO's settings to obtain the most out of your battery but I have found that just disabling the 4G does enough to conserve the battery. Now the question whether or not EVO's battery life suck with 4G enabled can only be answered once there are other 4G phones available in the market. You surely can not compare a 4G battery life with another 3G smart phones can you?CAMERA: I find the camera to be satisfactory. The pictures look amazing on my EVO's 4.2\" screen but they do not look as sharp on my 19\" monitor. The color saturation however seems appropriate to my untrained eye. I'm uploading a couple of snapshots, take a look and decide for yourself. Shooting in dark/indoors is an absolute joy because of the flash.PHONE: The best part was when I logged into my EVO with my gmail account, ALL my gmail contacts popped into my EVO - without me having to do anything! I remember moving my contacts from myBlackBerry 8700CtoHTC Tiltwas a tricky exercise and then moving my contacts to my iPhone 3G was a completely manual and tiring process! You have no idea how happy I was when I found out that I can now simply add all my remaining contacts into my gmail account (on my computer) and they will sync to my phone wirelessly instantly and automatically. And this works in the other direction too... meaning, whatever contacts I add to my phone sync with my gmail contacts. This means that no matter what phone I use in future, all my contacts are always available to me right there in my gmail inbox! Another great feature is that I can now be scrolling my phone book and from their check my friends' facebook or flickr or messages and come back to phone book! This is a feature of Android OS. As far as the call quality is concerned, I have no complaints.SPRINT TV: I simply disregarded this app as a Sprint bloatware at first, but started to like it later. This is free mobile tv service that you get from Sprint (only for EVO I believe). It gets a few channels like NBC, CNN, ESPN etc. I really had a good time watching some Wimbledon and FIFA matches live on my EVO in my office. One day, two of my colleagues came to my cube and started bragging about how their iPhones could display the live scores of any and all the FIFA matches and I simply started ESPN mobile showing a live FIFA match on my EVO. The look on their faces! Oh man... I almost made them cry that day without even saying a single word. Great Success! :)KEYBOARD: With a larger screen, you'd expect typing to be easier on EVO but that is not what I found. I think because the screen is larger, my thumbs have to reach farther and hence register a lot of wrong keys in the process. ENTER SWYPE! This is like a third party keyboard app that you can install on your EVO. Although you won't find this in the marketplace but installing it is still very easy. The best thing I like about swype is that it is very forgiving and I don't have to be accurate to type any more. And it remembers whatever new (non-English) words I type and predicts them correctly in future.WIDGETS: It took me a while to check out all the HTC widgets that were installed on my EVO and I now prefer them. The HTC News widget is better than most RSS readers that you can find in the market (free or paid). And I also like their Friends Stream... a nice way to aggregate all feeds from facebook, twitter and flickr into one single screen. I even like their Clock widget especially because a single touch takes me to the bedside/night clock screen and with the built-in kickstand, this has now become my favorite thing to stare at during those nights when I can't fall asleep.NAVIGATION: Considering the fact that it uses Google Maps, I have no doubt that the data presented here is more accurate/recent than my TomTom. I have not yet been able to give this a full try because I don't have the car mounting kit. But from whatever searches I did (for fun), it seems to be very fast and finds places accurately even when spoken to in my thick Indian accent. I foresee myself ditching my TomTom for this because of the accuracy of Maps data and also because I no longer have to connect my GPS to my computer every 6 months to install all the latest updates! And the screen here is bigger anyway displaying more information in a glance. Plus it's free! You can't beat free.TETHERING: From whatever information I could find so far, it appears that tethering is not very difficult once you root your EVO. If you do not want to root, then there are paid tethering apps available in the market. I hear that the next android update (2.2) brings the tethering capability natively to the phone. Currently, I have no real need for tethering my EVO because I don't yet own a tablet computer, but once I get that, I know I can easily tether it to my EVO and enjoy the internets whenever wherever however I please. This was a big point for me to move to Android.To sum things up, HTC EVO 4G is absolutely the best smart phone I have owned so far. It sure has some quirks but the goods far outweigh the bads in my opinion. I find my EVO very easy and enjoyable to use and recommend this to everyone. I can not wait to see what capabilities Android 2.2 and 3.0 will give to my EVO. The only thing that can make me give up my EVO is an HTC EVO2 (or whatever they decide to call it). You'll notice that I did not speak about things like video camera, music player, radio etc. Well, I have not used them enough to be able to provide an informed feedback. I had never copied a single song on my iPhone and I don't think I'll copy any songs on my EVO. Not that I don't like to listen to music, but whenever I do... I prefer to sing them myself :P", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Smartphone", "unixReviewTime": 1279497600, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2010"}

Secondary, video conference cameraThe Bad:Slightly rough softwareVery poor battery life without serious work by the end-userThe Ugly:Sprint's additional data fees for owning the Evo, charged even on premium plans with unlimited data includedThe HTC Evo 4G is an amazing smartphone. It makes making actual phone calls seem like an afterthought. It plays music and audiobooks, takes gorgeous pictures and videos, runs the Amazon Kindle application for print media, opens web-pages with full flash implementation, plays games and even offers GPS-functionality. Its large form-factor allows it to enjoy significantly greater  screen real estate than competing phones providing for a forward-facing camera in addition to the high-resolution, eight-megapixel main camera on the back of the phone that takes *stellar* pictures and videos.Battery life is a bear on the Evo. Unless you are a prepared to become a savvy user, the Evo 4G's battery life will jump up and bite you.Users have complained of battery life of less than eight hours with the Evo and this isn't an exaggeration: Out of the box, the Evo 4G is set up to constantly run programs in the background that automatically go online to check for news, mail, weather and other updates. This means that, unless you research how to turn off those things, your phone burns the candle at both ends, invisibly processing when its next update is going to take place *and THEN* going online to perform the update. In other words, your phone uses itself even when you aren't using it.The result for the unsophisticated user is comedy: the first Evo I ever saw was shown to me by a customer at Best Buy: it was stone dead. The second one was owned by a Best Buy sales rep who said he didn't have a power-problem; he just carried three fully charged, extra batteries around with him!This is not to say that the Evo 4G has to be a power-hog. With light data and phone use, I regularly get eighteen hours out of my Evo with a record time of twenty-three and-a-half hours on a single charge; but this happened only after many hours of research, and battery-conditioning voodoo. This is a bad constrast with my previous Blackberry smartphone which could be left turned on and off the charger for several days without worrying.There is a silver lining though: with the unit turned off, the Evo charges to full in about 2.5 hours--far faster than any other phone I've ever owned.In terms of connectivity, the Evo 4g is like nothing else, but this is expensive on many levels. The Evo  works its magic by using no less than four different radio transceivers (phone/3G, bluetooth, 4g, wifi, and Satellite GPS) of those however, 4G is problematic on several levels.Sprint charges a ten-dollar-a-month premium just for owning the Evo 4G, even if the user has Sprint's `simply everything' plan that includes unlimited data. The fee still applies even if you live somewhere where Sprint isn't even dreaming of setting up 4G anytime soon.This means you pay for 4G even if you can't have it and are already paying for a super-premium plan where `unlimited data' is included. That, speaking plainly, is a rip-off--so much so that there are stories floating around of Sprint employees in call-centers living through the nightmare of having to explain the charge to irate customers by describing how wonderful the phone's screen is.I would genuinely hate to be one of those people right now.The problem with Sprint's 4G service is that it is a costly paradox. If you are anywhere where you can use wifi from a coffee shop or from your home or office, wifi costs either nothing or next to nothing and is easier on your battery than 4G would be. So how is 4G in any way useful? You *could* use it to tether devices to the Evo, providing a moveable, wifi hotspot of your own to, say, watch a movie on an iPad or a laptop.Unfortunately, two things prevent this even if you live in a place where 4G actually exists: 1) Sprint charges a $30 a month super-premium for wifi tethering on top of the charge for data (yes, Sprint expects a yearly, $480 Christmas Present) and, 2) using 4G alone, on battery power will turn that, sleek fully-charged smartphone of yours into a paperweight in less than an hour no matter what background processes you turn off. Contrast this with AT&T;'s 3g service for my iPad 3g: $25 a month for 2GB of data with additional 2GB blocks for $10 if needed.You can tell that Sprint knows how popular their pricing policies are with consumers: when Android hackers came up with free wifi-tethering solutions for the HTC Evo, Sprint's system software updates disabled them--sort of like a thief wrecking the zipper on your pocket.Despite all the reasons to be bitter about its carrier, the HTC Evo 4G is a great smartphone that offers sophisticated users a host of great features. It does everything the iPhone does and more and, although its software is rough in some areas, Sprint's network makes the Evo plainly, obviously superior.The HTC Evo 4G is a great smartphone but you wish it were available from a carrier that was less hungry than Sprint is; because Sprint's pricing for data makes your phone bill feel like an expensive insult to your intelligence.**Addendum** Apr 8, `2011: A difficult, but worthwhile fix.Please note, if you try this, you'll be trying it as I did: that is, at your own risk. With that said...My phone slipped out of my hand while I was taking it out of the holster and it fell several feet onto concrete  shattering the screen. This was completely unexpected. My phone's screen has survived much more dramatic abuse than this, but this time I was unlucky and for more than a month, I was walking around with a screen that looked like a crazed spider had taken up residence underneath it.Despite my phone's being insured against loss or theft, I was considering buying a new one when someone told me something I should already have known: the parts and tools were out there and, although the work is certainly not trivial, a home-grown repair-job was possible.I got instructions on how to disassemble the phone on YouTube and bought the relevant part (the screen) and the tools (a number-four Torx screwdriver) on Amazon. Instead of the specialized tool recommended in the YouTube video, I bought a set of super-heavy guitar picks and used them for the two operations crucial to taking the phone apart: opening the case by sliding a thin, non-conductive instrument into the phone seams to separate the phone's assemblies that are held together by snaps *and* six Torx screws, and flicking open the locks that keep the phone's ribbon connectors attached to the phone's motherboard.The hardest parts of the repair were prying the bits of broken screen off the adhesive backing that holds it it to the front of the phone and getting the three ribbon connectors back into the clamped busses that move signals between the phone's parts and its motherboard. Also, the motherboard is attached to the phone's chassis by a single, tiny, phillips head screw that I lost during reassembly (I lost the phillips head, but the phone went back together without it and, so far it works fine).If you're going to try this repair, I would recommend that you magnetize your screwdrivers and set the screws and other small parts aside in light-colored cup for maximum visual contrast so you can spot everything easily when it's time for reassembly. In addition to the tools mentioned above, you will probably want a  needle-nosed tweezers and a lint-free cloth for cleaning any smeared adhesive off of the liquid crystal display underneath the glass.Getting the phone back together after disassembly requires a lot of tries and a *LOT* of patience, but the reward for success is stellar: first, you get to show everyone that you did it (as I intend to tomorrow) and the total cost of the tools and replacement parts (all of them with next-day shipping) was less than a hundred dollars while a new Evo bought without a plan costs four-hundred and fifty.Good luck.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The HTC Evo 4G Android Smartphone: A great smartphone with a weak carrier", "unixReviewTime": 1288224000, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2010"}

I have been with sprint for some time and really wanted to get an iPhone, but did not want to change service providers.  My previous phone was the Samsung Instinct, which was \"supposed\" to be Sprint's answer to the iPhone.  Needless to say, I was skeptical at best when the HTC Evo was announced because I had been burned before (if the Instinct was the answer to the iPhone, I must have asked the wrong question).  I did a little online research comparing the Evo to the iPhone and was sold.  Luckily I was quick enough on the draw and was able to score one of the last Evos in the first batch sold.  I've had for some time now and really have no major complaints.  This phone surpassed my expectations.  As a person that really craved all the neat tricks the iPhone could do, this phone meets and exceeds all of that.  I even was able to download some of the same apps that are available for iPhones, so I no longer feel left out.  Some folks are totally anti-iPhone, that's not me.  If sprint had offered it, I would have gotten it hands down.  But now, I say iWhat???  There are tons of things that you can do with this phone.  I won't repeat everything that other folks have said.  I'll just tell you a little about my experience with the phone compared to my last, the Samsung Instinct (1st Generation Instinct).Apps Galore!  As some folks have said, after about 10,000 apps is there really a need for anymore?  Sure, iTunes offers more apps than the Android market, but you can't possibly put them all on the phone and they tend to get repetitive.  I can't tell you the best apps to get as it depends on how you're using the phone.  I can say that if you want it, more likely than not Android market has some version of it and many you don't have to pay for.Transition from other phones.  Coming from the Samsung Instinct, I had very little trouble transitioning to the style of this phone's touchscreen.  Granted there are some differences, such as the touch and hold bringing up new menus and the touch screen being much more sensitive.  But the differences were all improvements so I have no complaints.  Also, my contacts and pics, even my messages all transferred over with no problems.No phone is perfect.  The drawback on this phone is definitely the battery life.  However, this is becoming a problem across the board as phones are able to do more and more things, so this is not unique to the Evo.No service provider is perfect.  These days even a great phone can be hampered by poor service (i.e. iPhone/AT&T;).  Every service provider has some quirk or issue that will upset some subscribers.  As a person that has been with virtually every provider (I still remember the old PrimeCo commercials, lol), Sprint's positives far outweigh it's negatives especially compared with other providers.

From the other reviews, you will have noted the important features that are attracting the gadget nerds, the business users, and the folks who are just looking for a good feature package. There were several features that captured my imagination. I like what Steve Jobs has to say about \"face time\" in his intros to the new IPhone, and I thought for a while that would be my new phone. I really like the idea of being able to create a wifi hot spot -- though with the number of hot spots growing exponentially, this is not as important as it would have been even a year ago. I really like the nav function, and I must say the android versions are far superior to the Garmin, Magellan, and Tom Tom devices I have used in my autos. I was immediately attracted to the significantly larger screen because we use our phones to download and read research documents -- Word and Acrobat files -- as a part of our teaching and research work.I am also impressed that Sprint has taken the lead on the deployment of 4G. It's not available in my city and is not therefore a deal maker/breaker for me -- but it is 4G that will prevent overloads and delays on the mobile networks, so it's an important move for a service provider.I currently have an IPOD Touch, and I frequently use about two dozen apps from Apple's App Store, and I like that most of them are free or very low in cost, so that's another feature I looked to the new IPhone for.But the deal-maker for me lies in another direction.  I am very disenchanted with many American businesses, and I consider AT&T; to represent the epitome of unbridled greed. Like other companies you can think of, AT&T; never misses an opportunity to increase their rates or add charges, just a little. You need to remember they're talking about millions of transactions each and every day, and while our tolerance for all the little changes is high, they eventually add up. I personally think it was a bad mistake for Apple to give AT&T; an exclusive, and that connection kept me open-minded as I looked for my next phone and service contract. I'm in an area where AT&T; is the phone provider, and there is really no suitable alternative, so when I moved in, I signed up for their \"bundled\" services -- local, long distance, and DSL.  Their ads promised me nice bonuses for signing on -- but I was not a bit surprised to learn that there were restrictions and conditions.  I didn't get a dime, and I received a level of service I had come to expect.  The phone line is just a line, and not much can be done to screw that up -- but I had problems with their DSL right from the beginning.  I opted for their highest speed service, and I had months of dropped connections and slow loads before I finally dropped them and signed up for cable.HTC sells their EVO through T-Mobile, (different name) except that it is married to the obsolete Windows Mobile 6 operating system. I like T-Mobile's service very much, and looked hard to find a suitable alternative.  I am currently a Verizon customer, eligible for a phone upgrade, and that provider has the HTC Incredible -- again the same phone, but with an Android operating system. When I compared plans, however, I found Sprint had the lowest cost of all the providers, with T-Mobile a close second. For the same services, AT&T; wanted nearly $50 more, and Verizon has been learning from AT&T; and B of A and now adds a nickel or a dime to everything they do. I would have had to pay nearly $100 more each month to get the same services from Verizon. AT&T; and Verizon both have caps on web usage, and the costs for extra use are very high. If you download and watch one movie, for example, after you have used your monthly capacity, the cost of that movie would be about $35!  I actually don't think we will ever approach those capacities as a practical matter, so that concern was not a critical one -- but why pay extra for the privilege of having a ceiling on your usage?I also will be very happy to walk away from Apple. I absolutely hate that everything I do on my IPod Touch is based on Apple's I-Tunes software. They want to control everything. I love their inventiveness, marketing, and manufacturing execution, and I actually came close to buying an IPad when I saw the announcement, but I will not miss the micro-controls inherent in I-Tunes and the Apple App store. I'm not a teenager who must buy the latest music on the market. The songs I now have available on my external hard drive include music that I purchased as 45 rpm and 33 1/3rd records, 8-track tapes, cassettes, and CDs. I resent that Apple feels compelled to monitor and control that inventory. For as long as I can remember, the music labels have been able to package junk with a few good songs so they can charge the higher prices.  I'm in favor of free enterprise, but those kinds of shady practices have long given free enterprise a bad name. Free enterprise means I can look for competitive pricing and services, and I spend enough time to assure I'm rewarding business practices of which I approve.I ended up with Sprint, and though no phone and no service is perfect -- I have previous experience with Sprint and like their customer service and prices. With what you'll read about the phone, you'll know it's feature rich, Android based, tough, and reliable. It's actually a little big as a phone, but that extra size is very important for all the other things a smart phone can do -- witness the rush to buy the IPad -- a large screen without a phone, camera, or USB connectivity. I'm very happy with my new phone and service provider and don't hesitate to call them a five-star combination.If I made anyone unhappy with the polemics I've delivered on different businesses, I apologize. My intention was simply to add the dimension of service to the important choices people are making about their mobile phones, and it must be apparent I've developed strong opinions about them. At the end, though, all I've done is exercise my right to take my business where I choose, and I've written this review to add a couple of considerations that may help others as they make their own decisions.That's what I think -- what do YOU think?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My considerations", "unixReviewTime": 1276300800, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2010"}

Ever. I have always had pre-paid phones so I knew that if I am going to get a contract phone for 2 years, it has to be something that is reliable and has a lot of features.I did a lot of research on this phone and a few others on youtube and other review websites as well and I looked at different cell companies and decided to go with sprint since they had the 69.99 everything data plan. There is a $10 premium for the 4g though.So far I am enjoying this phone. Has so much that it can do that its ridiculous. The screen is gorgeous. The colors they use are very nice. Its very responsive with the touch sensors and the 3g internet is very fast. I havent tried the 4g yet but since the 3g is so fast then obviously the 4g is faster still. There are over 50,000 apps on the android market. Most are free I believe.The call quality is very good so far. Even indoors I get a good recepition. Love the unlimited text that you get with this plan too. You can go to sprints website and see how many text you sent out if you want and how many minutes you used.The camera on this phone after you take a picture is gorgeous. The clarity is so good it seems useless to buy an actual camera. I love the camcorder to. The phone comes with a 8gb memory card installed so im sure it can record a lot of videos. You can upgrade up to a 32gb card if you want but you have to take the battery out to get to the memory card since the card is behind the battery. I heard they did that so that you wont \"crash\" the phone which is nice of them I think. It has two l.e.d. flashes on it when you take a pic and they also double as a flshlight so you can see in the dark. Very neat. The phone has a built in speaker thats also loud and sounds pretty good.As far as how easy the phone is to use, its somewhat easy. I am tech savvy and I love technology but I never owned a smart phone before let alone one with a touch screen so its something that I need to get used to. The instruction manual is almost 200 pages long so that shows you how much stuff this phone can do. Love the fact you can see the weather and you can also get traffic updates.The kick out stand on the back is very sturdy and its solid. It dosent look cheap at all. The phone seems to very durable although I wouldn't drop it. I am going to buy a case for it because the phone does seem kind of slippery to me.The size of the phone is not an issue with me. Thats actually another reason I bought it. I am 6'2 and I have big hands so I need a phone to match. But thats a personal preference.The battery life of this phone isn't that great but thats expected of a phone with a 4.3\" display and can do a lot of things. There are things you can do to extend the battery life of your phone. I'm in the process of doing that with mine. I dont have a newer tv with the hdmi port so I wont be able to try that feature on this phone until I can get access to one.There is so much to this phone I can't name it all. If you dont have a problem with the battery life then I highly recommend this phone. You can probably buy batteries with a higher capacity.PROS: camera, features, speed of 3g/4g, network seems strong, screen size, phone size, kick stand, hdmi port, charger doubles as a usb data cable, camcorder, dual flash that doubles as a flashlight, you can get flash on the internet, memory card is included, access to 50,000 plus appsCONS: battery life, phone seems slippery to me, $10 premium for 4g weather or not the area you live in has it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "HTC EVO 4G", "unixReviewTime": 1286582400, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2010"}

I would even go so far as to say it is THE best looking and functioning Android phone available on the market today from any carrier. And yet I am returning this handsome beast this week and switching to an uglier (in my opinion) Droid X with its clunkier Moto-whatever cartoony interface.All because of one culprit - battery life. Not once in the last 3 weeks that I've had this phone has it lasted a whole day on a single charge. I tried everything; Juice Defender, Advanced Task Killer, manually shutting off services when not needed, wiping out all of my home screens, turning off account sync, never using 4G, turning down brightness until I can barely see anything, etc. Everything short of getting an extended battery (which are currently too bulky/ugly in my opinion). Its not like I got a dud, since my wife got an Evo too (I went Black and she went White), and the experience has been near identical.If you have the luxury of always having an electric outlet at your disposal (even while on business trips, conventions, conferences, vacations, etc. when you actually find yourself using your smartphone the most), or, if you don't mind getting a bulky/ugly 3500mAh extended battery, then there really isn't any excuse not to get this phone. Neither works for me, so I'll have to say goodbye.Pros and Cons follow.Pros:1. This phone is beautiful. And that's an understatement. All eyes on you when you're using it in the office or in public transit. Curves are all in the right places (no humps like the Droid X). Nice smooth expanse of glass in the front (no plastic buttons like the Droid X). Nice touches of red. Many a time I've stopped what I was doing to just pick the phone up and admire it.2. HTC Sense UI is fantastic. Smooth flow, pleasing fonts, beautiful colors and shadows. Excellent collection of good-looking widgets. I generally mod my smartphone themes extensively since I'm rarely happy with the out of the box experience. But this thing is just beautiful. I played around with the Droid X at the Verizon store, and its interface pales in comparison. It looks cheap and cartoony. I understand that the Moto version is closer to stock Android, but I'm not so much a purist as I am someone who likes things to look good. I do suspect that Sense has some not-so-small role to play in the battery life on the phone. A lot of folks have reported insane improvements to their battery life by custom-romming their phones. But then Evo owners in general tend to overstate their actual battery times, so take anything you read from them with a pinch of salt.3. 4G speeds are insane. I have a very strong 4G signal at home (Burlington MA), and downloads just whiz past at 3Mbps. But I did find myself using it less and less (see Cons below). 4G would be invaluable if you have a strong connection at home and are considering tethering it to a PC / laptop to make it your primary internet connection. Provided of course that you live alone (since anyone else would be disconnected when you aren't home), this would totally work.4. Video calling. This isn't mature yet in my opinion, since my few attempts with Qik have been far from satisfactory. Half of the calls one of us had no audio (both using Evos), and it was very poor whenever one of us had no 4G. This is just a software issue I imagine, and should soon be rectified by better apps. But at least the hardware (front-facing camera) already exists should the right software come along.5. SWYPE! Yes, this gets an entire bullet point. The latest software update brings Swype to Evo handsets. Its made my decision to leave the Evo even more difficult (though Droid X has it too). Try Swype and you can never go back - it truly changes the way you type.6. 8MP Camera and 720P Video recording. I don't count MPs as indicators of camera quality. My actual experience with video recording has been good, and still photos 'OK'. I find phones inching closer and closer to point-and-shoots in quality, though they're not quite there yet. I carry a DSLR with me whenever I plan to take photos, so I'd never use a phone for still photos anyway. For video recording, its pretty good, and can easily replace a digital camcorder.7. Screen size at 4.3-inches is perfect for most things you'd use a smartphone for. Web browsing is very good in landscape mode. You can also actually start to enjoy videos at this size. I feel that 800x480 is the perfect resolution for a device of this nature.8. Its an Android device! I saw a remote desktop application called PocketCloud in the Market and my love for this device instantly doubled. I have to go through a complicated Corporate VPN system to access my mail and other work systems, so this gives me so many more situations where I can just leave my laptop hooked up at home or at work. 800x480 is also a very workable size for RDP. Its like having a tiny laptop running XP in your hands. 4.3-inches of real estate is also essential for using the virtual mouse that comes with PocketCloud. Of course, I don't stay connected longer than 5-10 minutes at a time for fear of draining out the battery on the Evo, but its still a big deal.Of course, there are dozens of other pros with this super-phone and I could go on and on. But a lot of others already have. So I'll stop here and switch to the Cons.Cons:1. The Battery life sucks! There's no nice way to say this. Coming from a Nokia XpressMusic 5800 that was also capable of full-GPS and 3G web browsing, but could still last 2 days with very heavy use and a week(!) with moderate to low use, to say that the battery life on the Evo was a shock is an understatement. When I use this phone heavily I need to charge it THREE times a day. If I don't use it at all, it still threatens to shut down by nightfall. Short of custom-romming the phone, I've done everything in my power to extract a few additional hours from this phone, and failed. I knew of poor battery life before going in, but the scale of poorness was still not expected. I also see a lot of Evo owners misguiding others by quoting unrealistic numbers (\"I got 27 hours with moderate use!\", \"I rarely use the phone and I can get by 3 days without a charge\"). After combing through the forums and following every advice I found on both my and my wife's Evos, I must say that these people either got experimental super-batteries, or they're just making things up to evoke envy. Also, the Evo's battery charge indicator isn't perfectly linear. It stays most of the time between 30% and 70%. It drops quickly from 100% to 70% and very very very quickly from 30% to 5%. The phone shuts off within 15 minutes of the 5% warning, even if you do nothing to the phone. I really love this phone, but I could not imagine spending the next 2 years constantly worried about being stranded somewhere with a dead phone whenever I check e-mail or use the GPS. That's a deal-breaker in my book. Super-phones need to come with super-batteries. If HTC came up with a battery with 50% more juice without altering the form factor too much, I'd switch back.2. The camera makes contact with whatever surface you place it on. This makes it essential to get a case. Fortunately there are several good looking inexpensive cases out there for the Evo. The camera also adds to the unique looks of this phone so much that I probably wouldn't change anything even given a choice.3. One of the side effects of combing the forums looking for battery extending tips, was the finding that a disproportionately large number of people cracked their Evo screens or the plastic at the top of the phone, by seemingly minor falls. I can imagine how I'd feel if my $500 phone slipped from my hand/pocket on to the carpet and shattered its screen. User reports indicate that the Droid X is much more resilient to drops. The first few days I had the Evo I did not have a screen protector yet. So I was very careful not to put coins or keys in the same pocket. Only once I forgot and dropped a key into the same pocket. The result was a tiny (4mm) hairline scratch. Not very noticeable, but its there.4. 4G implementation on the phone is far from ideal. If you need to download something specific quickly, or if you need a short tethering session, that's great. But if you use 4G longer than an hour, the handset starts heating up very quickly, and the battery drains out completely within 2-3 hours. I suspect that the heating is related to the rapid battery drain rate, but its disturbing nevertheless.5. I don't have 4G coverage at work, and even the 3G coverage is spotty. They're both very strong at home, but one of the main reasons for wanting a smartphone was so I could access my personal mail from work. This is nothing against the phone though. It doesn't even say anything about Sprint, since I'm sure Verizon has some spots where Sprint is much stronger too (I believe this is more so in the west). It just means that for my particular situation, Verizon 3G is probably better than Sprint 4G.Returning this phone is one of the hardest decisions I've made in a while, but one that I believe must be made. My wife even reported feeling envious of the last longing looks I've been giving the phone the past few days :)If you're on the fence between an Evo and a Droid X, I suggest you try the Evo first. Sprint has an amazing 30-day return policy. So amazing in fact, that I'm actually feeling guilty about taking advantage of it.Since the phone is married to Sprint, I think a few notes about Sprint are warranted as well:1. My relationship with Sprint got off on a bumpy start. I ordered through the online Sprint Store (so I would have control over entering coupon codes like SAVE50, and so I could easily apply employee discounts as well). I expected the plan to start from my activation date. But I was surprised to find it actually starts from my order date! So though I ordered on 11/22, received my phones on 11/29 and activated them on 12/1, my billing started from 11/22. For a $130 monthly bill, that represents an unnecessary loss of at least $32.50. However, in Sprint's defense, I chose the wrong time to order - the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. If you order by Wed morning during a typical week, you should get the phones within 2 days. Also, Verizon just did the same thing when I ordered through them (i.e. starting billing from the order date). But they shipped overnight, so I only get billed for one extra day.2. Sprint ported over my wife's number several days before her phone got here, meaning she was left with no phone for a few days. This was more than a minor inconvenience, since she was expecting several important calls. We later found that this happens fairly frequently and the best bet is to order the phones as new lines and port them after they arrive.3. Except for poor 3G/4G connectivity at my workplace on the 16th floor, I've had no other issues regarding connectivity. Voice calls were never an issue.4. Cancelling the account with Sprint was super easy. No one caused any trouble. We weren't even asked why we wanted to cancel. Just remember to both cancel your account and initiate the return of your phones within the 30 day period (which starts from your order date). If you miss either step, you might find yourself with a bill for the ETF.5. Overall, Sprint represents tremendous value. Especially when you get a discount through your employer, but even if not. The fact that you have unlimited mobile-to-mobile calling irrespective of the called-party's carrier is a big deal. Even after paying an extra $20 for 4G (two of us) we were still hard-pressed to find a plan from any other carrier at the same cost for similar benefits.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best phone I ever had - But I had to return it", "unixReviewTime": 1292803200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A3LZEFHIYZ1FGA", "asin": "B003N9B3CY", "reviewerName": "Sajid Ansari", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I took a risk from jumping from the iPhone 3GS to the Evo.  I really thought the iPhone was an excellent phone, but it pales in comparison the Evo and to the Android OS in general.  While most settings in the iPhone are set in stone, the Android powered Evo allows the user to make the phone extremely personalized in each and every way, from custom operating systems, to different keyboard layouts, one-touch navigation directions, video chat over cellular network, custom widgets, and on and on.  One could write a book on advantage of Android vs iOS, but in short, the iPhone OS is simply a page of apps, whereas the Android's OS is so much more, making the phone experience more personal, more fun, and more productive.  Two key disadvantages in the iPhone vs EVO battle: The clarity of the iPhone's retina display is purely unmatched.  When you zoom in on HD pictures and take a close look, the iPhone is by far clearer and sharper than any other device.  The 2nd disadvantage is battery life.  Evo's battery drains fast due to the more complex Android OS and the Evo hardware power requirements.  While the iPhone can stay charged during normal usage for 2-3 days, count on recharging the Evo before the end of your 8-hour day.If you are comparing the Evo to other Android powered devices, you'll want to consider both hardware and software specs.  The key competitor between the Evo and other Android phones is Verizon's Motorola Droid X.  In terms of hardware, the Evo's huge 4.3\" HD screen is unbeatable, and only matched by Motorola.  This larger screen makes typing on the virtual keyboard much more accurate and easier to use than smaller screens.  A very similar typing experience to the 4.3\" screen of the Moto Droid X, but because the Evo's shape is smooth and continuous, unlike the glaring protrusion of the camera on the back of the Droid X, the Evo both looks and feels better in this department than the Droid X and any other phone.  The Evo also has the awesome 8.0 MP camera, capable of taking the most stunning HD pictures, turning you into a semi-professional photographer.  The 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of memory makes the Evo a very sharp, crisp, and lag-free phone.  Of course, if you wanted more power, the Android OS lets you unleash the nerdy side of you, and work on things like custom operating systems and overclocking.Comparing the software side of the Evo to other Android devices, the key ingredient here is HTC's home screen launcher they call HTC Sense.  This home screen launcher is what sets HTC devices apart from other Android phones, in terms of look and feel of the phone.  I have compared HTC Sense with the likes of Samsung's Touch Wiz, and the custom Launcher Pro.  Overall, I adore HTC sense because of it's extremely useful, simple, and well decorated widgets, and dock at the bottom of the screen.  Again, thanks to the open-source of Android, you can always tinker and play around with home screen settings and different home screen launcher apps to make the experience exactly fitting to you.As for the Sprint network, I personally have been extremely satisfied overall.  One thing that is hard to swallow is Sprint's $10/m charge for 4G, even if you don't use it.  Right now, 4G is so spotty, that unless you are in a well covered area, the 4G actually DECREASES the phone's speed because it gets bogged down with trying to retain a weak connection.  However, in a well covered area, the speeds area amazing at around 4 mbps and under 100 ms ping times.  When 4G isn't available, the 3G coverage is reliable and fast.  When I was making the jump from AT&T;, I considered Verizon and Sprint, and ultimately chose Sprint because of much better pricing.  Under their family plan, you can select 2 lines for $129.99 and be sure that you will never go over thanks to unlimited mobile-mobile calling, texting, and web data.  Of course, that doesn't include the $10/m mandatory extra charge for 4G.  Even with that, Verizon's plan would set you back around $170/m if you were to get unlimited calling among 10 favorites, which is almost a must to have since their included minutes are so few.For me, I am glad I made the switch, and I am much more impressed with the Evo than I ever was with the iPhone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Switched from iPhone and not regretting it", "unixReviewTime": 1295568000, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2011"}

I had my land line disconnected and bought a Bluetooth device (Nuvelli) that connects all my former land-line phones to my EVO so I can answer my cell from any regular phone in my home regardless of where the EVO is.  I am also using the Hot Spot for all my WiFi devices, including my TV--Netflix streaming is seamless with the 4G network and I've never see it stop to buffer as it occasionally did with the DSL modem.  In Chicago, I was paying more for my land line + DSL modem than I am now paying for my EVO with Hot Spot (plus I have all the phone options like caller ID, call-forwarding, voicemail, etc., for free with the EVO).  I loved saying \"Goodbye\" to AT&T.  The EVO is still amazing me after two months.  I use the TeleNav system and it is far better than the GPS system I was using (it needed a costly upgrade to be up-to-date, so I saved on that, too); my older system did not have real-time traffic warnings, nor did it show me the speed limits of every road I was on, nor did it warn me when I was approaching a traffic camera).  The ability to use the Internet to find a place that is not listed in the usual \"Places\" listings, click on \"Map It\" and have the option to use the TeleNav system to route me to the place I just found on the Internet is amazing.  The EVO has replaced two other, more costly and less efficient, devices I was using:  MiFi and Internet access using Sidekick.  With MiFi, I had to constantly check the number of MB I had used to be certain I had not gone over my monthly limit.  The Internet access with Sidekick was an inferior platform that was 3G slow.  The Internet access with EVO is fast and it does everything I can do with Windows--including the use of multiple windows.  The camera takes pictures that are every bit as good as my 10 megapixel digital camera, it takes great video, and it is so easy to send pictures from the EVO.  I also use a free app for my grocery list, keep track of all those little key ring cards with another free app that replaces those tags altogether, and can download coupons to my grocery card while I'm shopping--when I check out and they scan the card (on my phone), all the coupons automatically show up on my register ticket.  I also schedule my TV programs from a DirectTV app and can order the pay-per-view using the same app without having to call.  Everyday I find something new to love about my EVO.

With a 4.3\" LCD and the coveted 1Ghz Snapdragon processor, it is a hefty competitor in the smart phone market. With over 15,000 apps to choose from you can rest assured that the giddy feeling you get from a new device will not end soon. Having owned the phone for almost two weeks, I can provide a good review on what to expect from the HTC EVO 4G.PROSIt has 4G: This is a first in the smart phone industry. Sprint has been touting its ever expanding 4G network but has never had a phone enabled with 4G to use it with until now, and let me say that the differences in speed are enormous. Downloading on Sprints 3G network hit around 1.0 mb/s, Upload 256 k/s. Downloading on Sprints 4G network hit around 3-4 mb/s and, Upload 1-1.4 mb/s! I took a pic of one of my Speedtests, you can find it in customer images.It's huge: With the 4.3\" LCD display taking up most of the face of the phone, you will be surprised on how big the phone is. Tons of room to work with and movies look great. I can also add that the phone is a little thick and has a very firm and heavy feeling. (Good build quality)Responsive: Out of the box you will see that the phone is extremely responsive to even the tiniest touches on the screen, but seems to block out accidental tabs with the edge of your finger which actually makes the phone a lot more easier to use. Apps load in less than a second and the pre installed apps almost always load up instantly.8 Megapixel Camera: The camera is great. See an example picture in the customer images that I posted (Look for two geckos!)Front Facing Camera: The front facing camera takes fantastic pictures and has a very good looking video quality when used for video chat.720P HD Video: Recording at 720P at 25FPS, it takes surprisingly good video for a camera phone. Check out YT for a plethora of example videos (If you type in \"htc evo test video spacebears\" in the searchbar and view the first video that is a fantastic example of the video quality)Video Chat: The video chat is simply great, it can be used over 3G or 4G and is very responsive and not sluggish at all.Mobile Hotspot: For 29.99 a month you can turn your phone into a 4G hotspot. The data speeds are extremely fast and you can connect up to 5 devices at once.Kickstand: It's AWESOME. Doesn't let the phone fall over and is very sturdy. Don't expect it to break off.The monthly plans are cheap(er): Ranging from 69.99 to 99.99 for the Simply Everything Plans, you will most likely pay less over other carriers with similar features. But don't forget the 10 dollar premium data fee.CONS4G not in all areas, premium data fee mandatory: Currently Sprints 4G network is limited to around 25 major cities, but it is expanding continuously and hopes to cover 120 million people by the end of the year. Also if you order the HTC EVO 4G you will be subjected to a mandatory ten dollar premium data fee even if you aren't covered with 4G. Supposedly the funds are going toward improving and expanding the 4G network.The microphone sounds bad: The audio sounds like it is in mono and picks up a lot of background noise. No external mic port. Don't expect to be Vlogging with this anytime soon. (Firmware update may improve sound)UPDATE: Due to recent ROM updates, battery life has improved tremendously!Battery Life: Simply put, it sucks. You will need an extra battery if you are a road warrior. I can get through the 9-5 day without having to charge but I almost immediately have to plug it in by 6-7 o clock with normal use. Expect around 4-5 hours of HD video and around 12 hours if you use the phone simply for calls. Normal use you can expect around 8-9 hours. The good news is the knock off e-bay batteries are cheap.It's waitlisted: This phone has been waitlisted ever since it came out so good luck finding one!The HTC EVO 4G is simply a great phone and should be seriously considered if you are in the smart phone market :D", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best 4G and Android phone on the market", "unixReviewTime": 1279238400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2010"}

I purchased mine here and was amazed at the price and service.  I ordered it at 4:00 pm on a Wed and had it Fri with no issues.  I don't know why people continue to buy phones from the providers especially the ones like Sprint who continue to insist on making the customer deal with mail in rebates to get to their special price.  Like I told the Spring store guy, I can go down the road and buy it at Best Buy and get it for the final after rebate price or I can go online and get it even cheaper.So I am moving over from AT&T; and an Iphone 3G.  You really have to go up to an Iphone 4 before you can really compare to an Evo but while the Iphone 4 has some new features and better hardware the overall experience is exactly the same.First off the main reason why I'm switching is AT&T.;  They have the highest prices of all carriers and the worst service.  With the move to Sprint I'm dropping my cell phone bill by about $30 and getting more minutes.  AT&T; banked too much on their exclusive Iphone contract.  Yes they have a millions of people locked into contracts but we will see how the Verizon Iphone affects their business in the long run.  Hopefully Verizon doesn't make the same mistake, AT&T; never really addressed the network issues that arose from the millions of Iphone that suddenly got put on it with unlimited data (broadband speeds my butt).Apple, well they designed an amazing device and if it weren't for Android there still would be nothing in its class.  The only other maker that really took a poke at them as far as I know was Palm with the Pre and it was a poor attempt from a failing company.  The software was poor and the hardware was junk.  Oh, I guess maybe Blackberry with the Touch but it was only the look, it was still more of a business phone.  The thing that always bugged me about Apple was that they didn't want to let me do with what I wanted with the phone I purchased and owned.  Thanks Steve, but I can really take it from here.  I also didn't like the whole Iphone 4 signal fiasco.  There is no problem with the phone, your just holding it wrong, here is a free case to protect you from yourself.  Have another drink of the coolaide, everything is fine, you love our stuff.Ok, on overall polish the Iphone has the Evo (really Android) beat hands down.  Apps from the same company like Facebook are just done better on the Iphone.  Maybe they just need time like they had on the Iphone, who knows.  Since I have released the Iphone from the case that has protected it well over the last 2 years it just feels good in your hand.  The Evo is a little big, granted it went straight from the box to a case of its own.They Iphone from day one was just slow on data.  Even on wifi on blazingly fast broadband it was just slow rendering pages and getting data.  I never understood why, but tethered to a laptop the speeds were more what I would expect.  For that reason I never used it much for web surfing, it was quicker to fire up the laptop.  The Evo doesn't have that problem.  While still not as fast as a computer, its pretty darn fast.Here is where I am different from everyone else.  I have had no issue with battery life.  The Evo has been off the charger for 9 hour now.  Granted I have not made any calls but I have been playing with it and installing apps non stop and it still has 50% charge left.  Mine shipped with Android 2.2 which I have heard is better on batteries.  I did not change any factory settings, it came with bluetooth, 4g and wifi off.  I turned wifi on but thats it, there isn't 4g within 100 miles of here.  I think it may be better on the battery than the Iphone 3g.  I do think the Iphone 4 has some pretty significant battery life.Overall I am just very impressed with the Evo, its fast, there is no wait while an app loads, its just there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Another Iphone Comparison", "unixReviewTime": 1295654400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2011"}

I went through a good number of MP3 players before I finally purchased the iPod back in the day.  I liked my iPhone but had a number of concerns:1)  Steve Jobs - very controlling and slow at releasing updates to the iPhone which make it do what other phones have been doing forever..(come one...the 3G can't record video are you kidding me....can't send MMS messages until recently?...really?)2) Wasn't sure I liked the whole touch screen keyboard experience.  My text messages were horrible unless I slowed WAY down....misspelled words all the time.3) iPhone camera software stuck with shutter closed and apple says it was a \"hardware\" problem and wouldn't fix as out of warrenty (thank God my Geek squad plan covered it.)  But disappointing performance from Apple on this....a HARDWARE problem because an APP had the screen shutter stuck on closed?...maybe but didn't seem right.That being said I still wasn't sure about this whole android thing.....wow I was in for a suprise.  This phone rocks the face off of the iPhone.In addition to having the unnecessary but still cool \"Wow!\" factor...this phone does everything.  I can browse the internet and clearly read the web pages.  If I have to zoom in the text on the page \"word wraps\" the text so I can still read it without scrolling left--->right.The screen is awesome....nice colors, great resolution...awesome.The speed is great.The keyboard is bigger....but the really kicker is the SWYPE program which quickly made me forget about how much I loved my work Blackberry Keyboard (but hated everything but email)I had concerns about moving to Sprint as I had them about 5 years ago and hated their customer service and service.....they have obviously changed somethings.  Customer service is as good as ATT or better....more importantly...no dropped calls....great coverage....high speed ....AND I get unlimited EVERYTHING (except calls to landlines-450 min during peak)for $79.99....unlimited text included (ATT - $20) unlimited data (ATT  $30)unlimited mobile to ANY carrier included (ATT to ATT only)...ATT well over $100.I could go on but this is an awesome phone.....Oh yeah if you are worried about the number apps....don't.  Apple may have the numbers for now...but seriously how many \"tip calculators\" do you need to choose from...plus the Amazon Marketplace allows for some more \"colorful\" apps as Steve Jobs isn't dictating what you should or shouldn't do.  Also, there is still an app for almost anything you can type in the search field.Great phoneIf you are a \"small handed\" person you may want something more along the lines of the HTC Droid Incredible or the HTC Hero (maybe).  Hopefully Sprint will come out with a smaller phone like the incredible for those who mind the big screen (The incredible is basically this phone without a front camera and smaller - awesome phone).

Apparently there's a PIN and secret question that you fill out during ordering. I couldn't recall having to fill this information out. And for some reason phone companies believe that we all have memorable facts like the model of our first car embedded into our brains.Needless to say I could remember neither a PIN that I supplied during checkout or the secret question answer. Therefore during activation the customer service would not provide me with any information pertaining to my plan, etc.STOP.Yes, I do realize that Sprint implements these security measures to counter fraud.It seems however to be excessive to make a new subscriber walk a gauntlet of questions as they're trying to activate their phone. It was a most unpleasant experience and I'm not entirely sure if I'll be keeping this phone after the nasty interaction.My tip -- if you order this phone at Amazon -- or elsewhere -- be sure to WRITE DOWN any pin or secret question that you'd asked to supply. You'll need it to do ANYTHING with the phone once you get it.October 24, 2010I've run into what I consider a show stopping bug on my EVO 4G. When I am on pure 4G (not Wi-Fi or 3G) the phone won't connect to GTalk Instant Messaging. This is important because Android uses this connection to authenticate your market purchases. Without a GTalk connection you will be unable to purchase or download any applications.Since I've owned the phone my ability to connect to GTalk via 4G has been basically non-existent. I can make a connection from WiFi. I can connect from 3G.  When I switch on the faster 4G speeds (for which I'm charged an extra $10 per month) the GTalk connection times out with an error.I phoned Sprint technical support and was passed along to \"advanced support\" who quite incredibly (and wrongly) explained that the reason that the GTalk connection was not working was that it wasn't compatible with Sprint's 4G service (totally wrong).Use caution with Sprint - I'm still evaluating but so far the EVO 4G hardware is holding up ok (as soon as I figure out the GTalk connection issue). Sprint customer service and technical support are quiet a different matter.October 25, 2010Problems continued to persist with the Sprint EVO - primarily that the required GTalk component would not connect when I had 4G turned on. The helpful Sprint support staff ran the gamut of telling me that GTalk was incompatible with 4G and that the 4G service which was clocking 8 to 10 MB downloads on my EVO wasn't in fact active in my town.I completely wiped the device (twice) and tried another Google account. Neither worked.Sprint's clearly on the defensive as well about their added $10 per month for the privilege of having an EVO 4G which they quickly claim (wrongly) isn't compatible with their 4G service.I love that they answer their help lines touting their not ready for prime time 4G network too.You've been warned...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Favorable Phone - Sprint Customer Service Is A Pain", "unixReviewTime": 1287446400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2010"}

Luckily it comes with an additional port for a USB connection. I had to open up the car adapter and severe the wire from the USB Micro. It's safer to do that then to cut off the wire outside the case and be exposed to electrical hazards. After doing this, I got a spare USB micro cable and connected it to the USB port.Here lies the many problems with this USB port. The USB door is in the way of the USB-A connector. You really have to find a USB that isn't bulky so that it can fit. So I reopened the case and removed the slider/door so that I can fit my USB cable.After that, I came into another problem. The USB is too loose when I plug in the cable. I had to go one step further and tape/glue some cushioning on the flat end of the device so that it pushes the USB plug upwards when plugged in. How does this work? It works buy applying pressure so that USB is pushed upwards against the USB port. This stopped it from sliding out. I know what I'm saying is a bit vague, but my point is that this charger is full of problems that can be fixed.However, here is another problem. When charging my Motorola Droid 3 through the USB port, it takes forever to charge.

I am glad I read the reviews first and made sure I purchased the charger directly from Amazon.  We have Amazon prime and the charger arrived in two days.  The box was slightly crushed, and I was a bit surprised to find the Amazon cardboard packaging not secured with any tape.  But the charger did arrive in one piece and in the verizon retail packaging, complete with the $29.99 sticker still intact.  I've tested it out on short trips to the local target and the charger worked perfectly.  My HTC Thunderbolt shows \"charging (A/C)\" when plugged into this charger.  I like that the Verizon logo lights up to indicate proper contact.Since I just got it, I can't speak for longevity.  I will update my review later down the road with that info.  All in all, a great deal so far.[One Year Update]: the original review was on July 22, 2011.  I thought I'd do a quick one year update.  The charger still works perfectly.  I've since taken it on much longer trips to DC and NYC, and it performed perfectly.  I did run into an issue when it refused to charge both my Thunderbolt and my friend's iphone simultaneously.  But I think that might be more due to the crap car that we were in, which couldn't handle the power draw.  Overall, I feel the same - very satisfied![Jan 2013 Update]: Just want to quickly report that the charger is still going strong.

I swapped the drive, same issue. Swapped the drive case, same issue.  Weeks later (today) was doing ok and copying 200 gigs from one USB drive to another, plugged in my phone to the USB hub and noticed the USB drive that has been working fine died.

There could be something wrong with her USB charger and something wrong with my evo and the way it talks to a USB hub at work (I have the exact same everything at home) but I think it's the cable.

The indoor antenna is at the far part of the building and the directional antenna is pointed away from the indoor antenna. All these are best practices with this unit.An important consideration when using the directional antenna is to Google-up a map of cell towers overlaid with a topological map. Being able to accurately aim the directional antenna from the map will save time and perhaps some ladder climbing.It was pretty easy to install (except crawling in attic space!) and when accurately aimed it provided a great boost and clear signal.Bottom line is it works well for us and gets 5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Clear signal and 4 bars: Priceless!", "unixReviewTime": 1383436800, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2013"}

Although I have apps to check on the signal, for the most part they are all trying to check the 4G signal in performance. This system is not designed for 4G. So, it may not be apparent that a signal increase has been accomplished if you are just reading the bar graph on your phone. Even with some cell phones that make the status available, you would have to be sure the app or the phone are recording the 3G signal.It has made my signal solid and have no issues with conversations that I experienced with VoIP or using the cell phone without the DB Pro.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The DB Pro stabilized my signal", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2013"}

I have no case on my phone but using one should help this. I could also just cut the plastic tabs shorter. My moms iphone 4 in a hard case had no issues so bigger phones are fine.Seconds issue is with the home mount kit. the attachment point for the cradle to the gimble base is loose and works well in vertical mode. put it into landscape mode off balance the whole thing and it tips over. the Iphone 5 is one of the lightest phones out there so bigger phones must have it worse. I can make it work most of the time by putting a book on the desk stand but its a design flaw.

After installing a proper app to properly measure changesin signal strength in dB, from testing I noticed that mounting sideways )no mounts provided to do this with any amount of stability) gave me ~20 dB of boost!con: interference with FM radioTips I have read about online from forums: mount your antenna far away from the phone as possible, to avoid feed back loops/interference with your phone's built in antenna. Try decoupling antenna from the car ground by placing the antenna magnet over a piece of cellophane or similar insulator. Also,mount vertically per instructions and principles of radio wave physics. Paired with bluetooth headset the experience is seamless, try using an NFC tag to quickly toggle bluetooth when you enter/leave the automobile to save battery power if desired.In sum: test your phone position/boost result using a proper dB scale app, find out location of your internal antenna and get that as close as possible to the sleek (ultimately just test and try it in different positions), mount external antenna up high and far away and perpendicular to the earth, get a cheap second antenna for easy use in your home if needed.Note: uses a micro USB connector for power. Runs hot, measured mine at 124F with 65F cabin temps. Optional antennas with more gain necessarily have a narrower &#34;beam&#34; that they pick up in - this is physics and unavoidable.  6db minimum boost is 2x the power as it is measured in log scale.

We have not really had any problems, but we also do not use them like crazy, like some people use cell phones. We like the phone, which is small to carry around comfortably. We like the price, better than any other prepaid phone that we know of. We buy the 1-year 400 minute card, which doubles to 800 minutes. Plus the minutes roll-over from the previous year! With our following pre-paid cards, we have now well over 1,000 minutes on each phone. Also, we purchased the phones at Wal-Mart for about $15, with wall and car chargers and belt clip included. Not sure if it comes with those accessories here.For text messages, we noted that our e-mail address for our phones is AT&T.; And since this is a GSM phone, I suspect that this runs on AT&T;'s network.Also, to note: Ok camera on phone.

This LG 420G has been my favorite so far in terms of aesthetics, use and function.  It's a basic phone with web access and camera, although I use neither.  Unlike the photo depicted here, mine is nearly all black.The nice thing about the LG420G is that for under $20 you get a carrying case and a car charger with this (along with the standard wall charger).  You also get \"Double Minutes for Life,\" a benefit that for older models has been an extra charge.  The carrying case is a clip-on vinyl case that is attached to the belt loop.  One has to use careful force to turn the swivel from a vertical position to a horizontal position.  The fasterner is a flimsy magnet.  Twice now I've lost the phone while sitting down.  Luckily both times I found the phone stuck deep in the couch.  I now wear a brown hair band around the case to keep the handle from popping open and to provide added security.The phone itself is well-made.  I recently left it in my jeans pocket and it was submerged for about five minutes in hot water during a wash cycle.  When I realized the phone was in water, I immediately fished for it in the barrel, dried it out, removed the battery and placed it in indirect light.  A few hours later it was working again with no signs of water damage.  Whew! My Sprint phones were never this good.Activation is easy and fast.  I prefer to do mine over their website.One nice feature is having a voice recorder on this phone.  It's not high quality but it's great for leaving myself notes.  There's also the standard stop watch, calendar, quick dial settings, an alarm clock, notepad, \"secret notes,\" calculator, world clock, stop watch.My one complaint about Tracfone is that whenever you buy a new phone and want to transfer your number, you have to call their customer service number and talk to some Indian guy with a heavy accent.  The last one who worked with me on transfering the number was downright rude.  It also took me three days to get my number activated from another phone that had died on me.  (On a previous number transfer it only took me a day.) Luckily I was able to get by with my other phone that I keep handy for these emergencies.I could have transferred my number on-line via the Tracfone website but the last two times I tried that I noticed that not all my minutes were going to transfer over.  I didn't want to lose 500+ minutes so I had to endure that rude guy from India.  Hopefully this phone will last me a year so that I don't have to keep calling India whenever a phone dies.  This long ordeal is my one complaint about Tracfone.Other than customer support being questionable at times, I do have to praise the company for offering budget plans for the frugal-minded.  I get by with under 200 minutes a month so my 60-minute cards (which are doubled, remember?) usually last me.  The 60-minute card, however, only gives you 30 days of service.  I can handle that for $12/month and not have to worry about an outrageous Sprint bill every month, an experience that turned me off to Sprint and on to Tracfone.  I can add minutes with a quick visit to the website, or I can buy time via my phone.  Because I have been a loyal customer for several years, I also get additional deals via email for reduced minutes, etc.For no additional fee I also have international access so I can chat with my brother who lives in Germany.I live in SE Arizona and have no problems with reception at home or in town.  Although Tracfone shares towers with Verizon, I don't always get service in remote areas, but that's OK with me.  There are only two things in life that require my immediate response and chatting with friends or co-workers is not one of them.Overall I am very pleased with Tracfone and their products.  I like this LG420G model as well.  I dinged the company a star for their unfriendly (at times) customer service.  But for anyone looking for a bargain, someone who doesn't chat much or who hates being tied down with an outrageous monthly cellphone bill, who's not much into texting, you may want to check out Tracfone.  You can check for local availability via their website.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A bargain phone for the casual user", "unixReviewTime": 1291420800, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2010"}

Easy to use menus that take a little adjustment after using the Samsung Flight II, but she'll get used to it. My only complaint and the reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the wall charger did not have a usb cable incorporated. We happened to purchase an accessory bundle with case at the same time which just happened to arrive on the same day, so we have connection to our computer anyways.

We ended up having to return this for a refund and reorder the product for $5 more, even though the product was fulfilled by Amazon. They explained that even though the product was fulfilled by Amazon, it was shipped out by the seller. It turned out there was a minor moisture bubble in the lcd display upon receipt, so we had to return it to an AMAZON RETURN CENTER, and when my wife gave me the phone and wall charger to return, she forgot to remove her micro SD card. After contacting Amazon about the issue and a 3 day research time, I was informed that they were unable to find or retrieve the micro SD card, but that I could order another and they would reimburse me for the price (which was only $6.99 fulfilled by Amazon for a 4GB.) BE WARNED THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MEMORY CARD, THAT YOU CANNOT TRANSFER ANYTHING TO OR FROM A COMPUTER WITH A USB CABLE connected to this  phone; SO NO CUSTOMIZED MP3 RINGTONES AND NO REMOVING PICTURES. I can't tell why this is since there is internal storage, but since Amazon is more than handling the problem they retain the 4-star rating for the phone. As I noted before, my wife had the Samsung Flight II prior to this phone, and they take the same memory card, but for those of you purchasing this as a new phone and  who would like customized mp3 ringtones or to transfer pictures off the phone, it would be a good idea to purchase a usb cable compatible with the phone and either a micro SD card or micro SD card with SD card adapter if you have an SD port on your computer.

How many times have we been saying take off that bluetooth earpiece and toss it?  Well the blueant sound quality is impeccable (see number 2 below)HOT : Because of the superb audio quality the blueant must use the phone's internal voice recognition system.  The good news here is the sound is so good the phone can recognize speach over bluetooth - something I could not do before with bluetooth headsetsnot so hot: on my dad's setup - a motorola maxx ve (derivative of the razr) the blueant could not download his phone directory - but the ability to talk clearly to the phone made using it \"normal\" as using the phone without bluetooth.  Most BT headsets screw up the audio so much the phone can not understand its built in voice commands but they all worked on the blue ant.HOT : people you call on the H4 can't tell either A) you're on a speaker phone or B) you're on a bluetooth device.  They got it totally right on this setup and I'm very happy.In the end, we could not transfer the up to 2000 contacts into the blueant from the phone over bluetooth (thats more for smartphones) but the good sound made the blueant usable as a remote speakerphone to the handset in his pocket to abide by the california 'cant use your phone in the car' laws (except speakerphones)Personally i've used alot of speakerphones like conference room speakerphones from polycomm costing $1K and the sound quality out of the blueant is as good if not better - people are full duplex so you can break into a conversation if need be.Because of the great performance, despite its not working as planned on my dad's older model phone, I'lll give it 5 stars.  People calling him in his car can hear clearly, it comes with a car charger (cig lighter to mini usb), and is easy to use.  It seldom falses on a command (most commands begin with \"blueant!\" so it knows when it's being called upon)We also tried it indoors in a conference room where the polycom would normally go and people thought it sounded better as a speakerphone so the technology inside the blueant is top notch, hence the five thumbs up.  I almost made it a 4 star, but my dad's trusted phone is so old that I'm surprised it works at all with it. And that is talking to the cell phone via bluetooth with 100% success - unheard of before.Overall - I'm very happy - I would have saved 20 bucks buying it on amazon but I was not sure how good/bad it would be so I used the store with the real easy bring it back for any reason policy just in case.

Plus, being able to use the &#8220;spider-like&#8221; legs of the mount can allow you to use it in things like car vents. This review is meant to find out if the concept translates into real functional use.The spiderpodium mount has an interesting look with its multiple arms/legs which wrap around your device. It&#8217;s not the most attractive design in my opinion, but it&#8217;s meant to be eye catching and flexible, both in terms of appearance and functionality, which it certainly is. In using this mount at school as well as in a local coffee shop, I received a lot of comments and questions from many people. It&#8217;s definitely a head turner.The mount has a nice rubber feel, and it wraps around devices well, whether they have cases on or not. The arms are extremely flexible, but they are not so easy to move such that your device will fall out of the mount, nor will the legs propping up the device flatten out. Each of the arms has little grooves every so often across the length of the arm so that you have a rough idea of where you need to bend it. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this isn&#8217;t the only place where it can bend; it can bend across the entire length of the arm.In using the mount, I found it was difficult to figure out the best orientations to place each arm in for the desired orientation of the holder (landscape, portrait, different viewing angles, etc). Luckily, on the box itself, there&#8217;s pictures that show a lot of the different orientations you can place the arms in to get your desired hold of your device. And if you&#8217;re the creative type, I&#8217;m sure you can come up with even more orientations for the arms. I did have some trouble getting my spiderpodium mount to look exactly like the arms in the pictures in the box. After all, each arm moves independently of the rest, so it&#8217;s difficult to get it to be level with the other arms propping it up, etc.Overall though, it&#8217;s a great concept item that delivers with functionality, and I couldn&#8217;t find any major issues with it to warrant anything less than 5 stars. If you have many devices of different sizes, or are looking for a mount/holder that can work in multiple scenarios and environments, this is the mount for you.Incidentally, Breffo gave me a discount code for anyone who reads this review to use on their website. The code is REVIEW20, and gives you 20% off anything on their website!I was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation.

Shults", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewText": "I purchased this case to use for my Plantronics Backbeat 903 Bluetooth stereo headset, after I lost the trouser-pocket-pouch that originally came with that device.As comfortable as the Backbeat headset is to wear, being light and comfortable enough that I forget I'm wearing it, it bothers people. They look at me like I'm a martian, and wonder aloud if I'm going deaf and wearing hearing aids. Thus, when I enter into society, as a matter of decorum, I frequently remove the headset and stick it in a front pants pocket; --whence I have learned that the Backbeat headset does NOT play well with pants pockets! I have broken at least three of these expensive headsets in my pocket, so I started using the little carry pouch that came with the latest headset, to provide some protection, and boost survivability. It clearly helped. The headset stayed fresh and whole when I had the pouch, while in the short couple weeks it took me to get around to ordering another case, my pocket somehow broke a piece off one of the headset control switches (though it still works perfectly), and it started looking dusty and ratty.It took me a lot of time and effort to pick this case out, because it was VERY difficult to ferret out a case that might fit. Plantronics doesn't offer JUST the pouch for the Backbeat (they only include one with the set), and many of these types of carry cases offered on Amazon don't give details as to the size; --nor is it easy to be sure the thing is a good fit even if you have the dimensions. The fit is very important in that it not only has to be big enough to accommodate the headset, but small enough to fit in a pants pocket without being an unsightly, uncomfortable lump.As it turned out, my hour (or two) of searching and agonizing, and my best-guess purchase of this \"Blackberry Premium Zippered Leather Carry Case Pouch\", resulted in a pretty much perfect solution. It is JUST big enough to fit the Backbeat 903, with room I think, to squeeze in a USB-to-mini-USB connector (I lost the one I had when I lost the last pouch I had, and still have to order another). This new pocket pouch is a man-friendly black, and while I'll have to take their word that it's leather, it does seem to be sturdily made and of good quality. It is smooth and flat, with no sharp edges, and it's sides are rigid, but with some flex, so it's compact and comfortable-in-pocket. I expect the rigidity of this new pouch (my old pouch was soft) will significantly enhance the protection afforded to my headset.I have yet to mention that the $4.50 price, with free shipping, is so low that it's almost like they're paying ME to own this practically perfect solution! I just ordered another one to keep on hand in case I lose this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect fit for my Backbeat 903/905 bluetooth stereo headset, pants pocket, and wallet!", "unixReviewTime": 1323475200, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2011"}

Based on those previous experiences I figures this was a smart buy, but either they changed the way they make their protectors or I got a really bad pair. I found 2 pretty critical issues with both of the protectors I received. First, the adhesive was very weak. This was a surprise to me because in the past the Seido protectors I had lasted for a very long time even with a good amount of abuse. In this case, however, I could feel right away that the tack was not very strong. I never really got a chance to put the lasting power of the adhesive to the test, though, because the screens I got were just slightly too large for the Evo. After an hour of working with the two I received I was unable to get them to stay within the glass surface. They were always just off enough to leave me with a corner that would not stick flat. I'm not new to applying these things either, so I can't rationally chalk it up to what I was doing. Ironically, the biggest complaint in other reviews on these didn't affect me. I was using the included card to try to smooth out the bubbles pretty aggressively, and I didn't see much scratching so take that for what it's worth. Given the large amount of positive reviews here, I couldn't blame someone for thinking I just got a bad set. If so, it's a shame.

Installation is tricky like any clear cover to be sure that some random flying dust particle didn't land on your screen before you could get it placed perfectly, but that is no different than any make of protector. My only complaint being, I would have liked the protector to go edge to edge, from top to bottom and side to side. It seemed when applying it, especially around the speaker on top, that, while acceptable to me, the fit was not precise. I would almost guess that they didn't have phone in hand when making their template. When framing the speaker, it doesn't follow the lines just right, close, but jut a bit off. It also is slightly smaller than the screen itself, so when installing it, it took a lot more effort centering it and getting it just right prior to setting it down. Fitting it closely to the speaker left about 1/8\" or so on the bottom.

Ironic choice of words huh?  Yes, it made the EVO's beautiful screen look less clear, as if turning an HD TV back to non-HD, not to mention the rainbow colors it showed on the center of the screen.  I quickly removed it and tried the other two brands.  You get what you paid for.Between the Seidio and Steinheil screen protectors, I'd say they are about on par, except the Steinheil Ultra Crystal had a brighter effect (it allowed more light from the EVO to reach your eye balls), and the feel against it had less friction than the Seidio.  If I had to choose, I'd definitely go with the Steinheil again.  Just don't make the mistake of what I did by first putting on the screen sticky by accident, and then realizing I needed to use the thicker screen protector.My wife also noticed the same thing too.  The Sedio clearly wins over the Three LCD Screen Guards.**** TIP 1: Do not use the stupid squeegie/plastic thing that comes with the product to smooth/remove air bubbles.  It will leave scratches on your screen protector.  Instead, use your thumbs by pressing down on the film against your EVO screen to smooth out the air bubbles as you lay down the protector cover.**** TIP 2: If you notice that there are particles underneath the protector cover after applying it already, get good ol' trusty Scotch tape.  It's good enough that it'll stick to the cover so you can peel the cover from the EVO screen easily (as the tape will stick to the cover) and will be able to pick up particles, and weak enough that it doesn't leave any messy residue.  For best results, have a 2nd person help you.If the protector cover is already laid down on the EVO screen and you want to grab a particle that's stuck underneath, you (the person holding the phone and applying the cover) take a piece of scotch tape and stick it on the protector cover so you can peel the cover up slightly.  Your partner in crime will then take another piece of scotch tape and stick it against the under side of the protector cover (right on the cover itself since the particle would have got stuck on the sticky side of it) to pick up the particle.  Once this is done, you can slowly release the protector cover back down and you should notice the particle is now gone.  I did this like a dozen times to remove small particles and it worked like a charm.  It's also best if you do not position your head directly on top of your phone when performing this, as to not cause additional particles from falling down.  If you don't have a partner in crime, you should be able to do this yourself if you're careful.

I inquired of Seidio once before with an earlier battery if they had any lab tests or something similar to back their battery capacity claims - and they did not.In any event, the  Seidio battery does last as long as the original and Seidio does stand behind their products, so at the end of the day I remain a customer, even if a suspicious one.Jerry", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Is it or isn't it?", "unixReviewTime": 1276387200, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2010"}

It's the same size as the OEM battery, so I didn't need to buy any additional parts - new back cover and a new case. I like my Otter case and frankly my EVO phone is already big enough, without adding more bulk to it.I carefully followed the advice to drain and fully recharge the battery five or six times after installing it. I've been rewarded with some pretty amazing battery life hours.Two things to bear in mind about this phone and this battery. First, at 1750 mAh, it's going to take longer to fully recharge than the stock OEM 1500 mAh battery. And I have read that the phone is calibrated to indicate a \"full charge\" when the battery reaches 1500 mAh. If that's true, then you should always let the phone keep charging for awhile after the green light comes on and the battery indicator reads \"100%.\" How long? I have no clue, but I usually plug the thing in at bedtime so by the time I'm ready to unplug it, it's had a few hours past the first green light, to build up a charge.Also, I happened to walk by a Sprint kiosk at a local mall, which was decked out with signs promoting the EVO. I spoke to the young man who was staffing it, mentioning that I liked my EVO. He was eager to help me change some settings to enhance the battery life. I hadn't had time to tell him I had a new, more powerful, battery, so I just smiled and let him get on with it. He tweaked a few settings and I think it helped. I'm no expert, and I recommend consulting with Sprint staff about your phone settings, if you find someone as helpful as I did.Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Definitely an improvement over the OEM battery life", "unixReviewTime": 1306627200, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2011"}

It's got a matte finish so the gripping is actually better than slippery cases like TPU cases. It's actually quite good. My only gripe is it's a little tricky to hit the power button (takes a little getting used to, but it's easy once you get the hang of it) But as for the 'squeaky' or 'creaky' sounds? I guess if you really squeeze the case hard enough, you'll get some sort of squeaky or creaky sounding effect. But aside from that, this is basically all I could ask for.

They first started as a company that designed unique and quality products for PDAs, which slowly evolved into Smartphones. They has a passion for innovation and this lead them to become the leading manufacturer of Smartphone accessories.They are also very well known for their rubberized cases. Many online forums and review sites have reviewed and vouch for their products. Their products are known to be built for quality and endurance.Currently they are carrying a variety of cases for the Sprint HTC Evo 4G, Ultimate Screen Guard Protectors, Spare Batteries, Chargers, Cables, and many more. You can visit their site here for all the details and see a list of their products (Seidio - Your Single Source for Premium Smartphone Accessories).Specs of Innocase II for EVO:Quote:Innocases have quickly become one of the most popular products Seidio manufactures. Crafted from a hard yet flexible material, it provides an amazingly thin layer of protection without adding the excessive bulk of other cases. The Innocase II consists of interlocking top and bottom pieces that fit your phone snugly, and Seidio's signature soft touch finish provides a great feel and better grip without attracting lint. It is also available in a combo, which includes a matching holster.- 1mm thin case provides scratch protection without adding much bulk- Designed from a hard, yet flexible material with Seidio's signature soft touch coating- Unique slide-in design consists of top and bottom interlocking pieces that fit your device snugly- Precision cutouts for ports, controls, and kickstandFirst Impression:HOLY!!!, I GOT IT, I GOT IT!!!!! I GOT IT, I GOT IT!!!!!The little brown square/cubed box arrived at my door early this morning. I was like \"wow\", quality service from Seidio. It was very nice of them to send me a review unit early before shipping date. I must take my time to thank them once more.As I took the products outside of the packaging, I saw the plastic looking case for the Innocase II. The product showed very well through the plastic container. It was definitely screaming at me to put it one. But before I did that, I took my dSLR camera out and started to snap some shots with my camera.One thing that I thought I would do better is move Seidio's Logo a little high above the inside background. You can't really see the Seidio logo from the packaging.Build Quality:Definitely not cheap. The build quality of the thing was hard. I wouldn't say hard as a rock, but it's definitely hard plastic. It was harder than those cheap eBay cases that you can get for 10 bucks shipped to your door. The rubberized feel of the case was also very good on your hands. It felt smooth and prevented the phone from slipping out of your hand.There was no sharp edges around any corner. or on the inside of the case. The inside of the case was very well thought out. They put some felt cloth in the backing so that it will prevent the back cover of the Evo from being scratched up.I also tried to double check on their advertised specifications by using a mm gauge to measure the overall thickeness of the phone before and after installing the case. You can find those pictures below.Fitment:I slipped the case and the Evo and it clipped together nicely and firmly. The right side and the left side of the case fit snuggly together and it fits the Evo flush on both sides.The cutout for the LED, Camera, and Speaker is perfect. There's enough space for the all three hardware specs. The camera glass is now protected because the case brings up the level to a point where the camera is indented inside the cutout location. No more worrying of scratching the camera lens when you put it on the table.I've also took specific pictures of each cutout location around the case to show you how they go around the buttons, insert holes for the charger, HDMI, power button and volume button. All those edges fit without gap in between and have been well covered with the rubberized layer to protect the phone.Forgot to mention, it covers all screen leaks from the edges.Protection:With the pictures showing 1000 words. I don't need to say much abut protection. They thought out every aspect of the phone do the point where there's felt inserts on the backing to protect the back cover. I wish they did one thing with the inserts though. They should have put the felt cloth all the way wrapping all aspects of the inside including the curved edges of the phone.Conclusion:In conclusion, the case lives up to the standard of innovation. They really did make a case that protected the phone real well. The design is slick and they did not have to include a bunch of artwork to make it attractive. It also keeps the phone low profile and gives the Evo a high class look while your on the phone or when the phone is sitting on your table.People always complain that getting a case at a high price isn't worth it. Or they complain that they want their phone naked. I think the reason they say it is because they can't get themselves to click the buy button. Some people settle down with cheap cases from ebay. But if you want a cheap case, that's your decision. If you want a high quality case built with precision and design to innovate, this is definitely the case to buy. Buying a cheap case from ebay would make your $450 phone look cheap also.They offer many different colors, so go to their site to check it out!The only thing I wished I had the honor of reviewing was the accessory that came with the case, \"The holster\". I didn't get a chance to get the holster so I couldn't test if the holster made the case even better. I'm sure the holster would give the case additional points!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seidio Innocase II Surface Case", "unixReviewTime": 1277942400, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2010"}

One piece is a soft form fitting rubber shell that comes up sufficiently over the front of the phone to protect it, but not cover the screen.  I was worried that the HTC EVO power button would be a challenge for any case, but it works with this case.  The cutouts are a perfect fit for the phone, and don't impede any of the functions...camera, stand, speaker, flash etc.  The second piece is a semi-hard plastic shell that fits perfectly into cutouts in the back of the case.  This piece acts as a clamp to keep the soft rubber shell securely in place.  Really cool design, and the hard plastic piece doesn't add any thickness over what the soft rubber case provides.  The thickness of the case does protect the glass camera, but that was what I expected.  The hard plastic also provides the benefit of making it easier to get out of my pocket, as the soft rubber would surely grab onto clothes...overall, the thickness is good for me...not too thick.Anyway, I highly recommend this case.

I had previously purchased (and reviewed) theAmzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for HTC EVO 4G (Black), and was hoping that the Innocase would be the last case purchase I would make for my new phone.  This case appeared to offer substantial protection with a form-fitting design.  I was drawn to the fact that this case has a plastic exo-skeleton which helped keep the rubber surround snug on the phone.  Early reviews for the case were also extremely favorable, with many users reporting things like a \"fit like a glove\".Six months of use has given me a good perspective on what this case does well.  I'm not sure if I have butter fingers or what, but I swear I drop my phone at least weekly.  This means that I have probably dropped my phone from decent heights 25 times or more in this case.  I am happy to report that my phone is no worse for the wear despite this relatively rough handling, and has nary a scratch on it.  The case is indeed snug because of the exo-skeleton and does a great job keeping dust and other grime away from my phone.I do have a few gripes with this case.  I first off do not like the added bulk that this case adds to my phone.  This added bulk combined with the larger surface area of rubber causes the phone to \"stick\" somewhat when I put it in or pull it out of my pocket.  \"Stick\" isn't really the right word, but that extra amount of rubber does create a sense of friction when pocketing my phone.  If this was the only drawback to this case, I would wholeheartedly recommend it simply because of the superior protection it provides.  Unfortunately, I have also noticed diminished reception with this case.I work in an area that has \"fair\" phone coverage according to Sprint's phone map.  On my phone, this translates to three out of six bars of coverage.  Shortly after putting the case on my phone, I noticed that my phone began dropping calls at work.  I called Sprint several times in an attempt to troubleshoot my phone, and nothing seemed to help.  I didn't even suspect that my new case was the culprit, so I just learned to live with the new worse coverage.  One day at work I went to swap out my battery with a backup I had purchased (one of the major drawbacks of one or no bar coverage is the fact that your phone switches to roaming a lot and eats your battery), and I noticed that after swapping the battery and setting the phone on my desk that the reception had improved back to three bars.  I further noticed that upon putting the case back on my reception dropped back down to one or no bars.Somewhat incredulously I repeated this exercise many times over the next few weeks.  Furthermore, I used the Speedtest app available in the app store to take 3G internet speed tests during random times of the day.  By simply removing this case, I averaged speed test increases of almost 150 kbps over those several weeks.  It became clear that the case had a definitive and repeatable negative effect on my phone's voice and internet reception.Because of these faults, I cannot recommend this product.  I bought the HTC Evo to be able to use it, and this case effectively renders usage difficult at best in areas with less-than-stellar coverage.  I have since gone back to using the Amzer case referenced above.  While the Amzer case may have issues with dust, it provides decent protection without negative reception effects.  If you are considering purchasing this case, I would strongly recommend that you pay attention to your reception levels throughout your day.  If you see three or less bars of coverage in an area that you frequent, this case is probably not the best choice.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice Case with one MAJOR flaw", "unixReviewTime": 1294444800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2011"}

After 3-4 months of daily usage, the case is just about finished.  I have dropped the phone once onto pavement - the case served its purpose and protected my phone.

A few days later while using my phone another corner broke off - I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary with it then.  Like other reviewers here I am also experiencing the rubberized coating \"peeling\" off - this doesn't affect functionality but it impact the nice look of the case.My last remark is that inside the exoskeleton there is a small square imprinted on the plastic.  This square has rubbed through the rubberized inner case and left a square mark on the back of my phone.  This definitely degrades from the prestineness of my phone's shell and case and is definitely an issue since this is supposed to PROTECT my phone, not damage it.Overall the case has a great feel and should protect your phone if you drop it, but be prepared to submit an RMA to Seidio to get a new exoskeleton every few months - if that will even work.

They first started as a company that designed unique and quality products for PDAs, which slowly evolved into Smartphones. They has a passion for innovation and this lead them to become the leading manufacturer of Smartphone accessories.They are also very well known for their rubberized cases. Many online forums and review sites have reviewed and vouch for their products. Their products are known to be built for quality and endurance.Currently they are carrying a variety of cases for the Sprint HTC Evo 4G, Ultimate Screen Guard Protectors, Spare Batteries, Chargers, Cables, and many more. You can visit their site here for all the details and see a list of their products (Seidio - Your Single Source for Premium Smartphone Accessories).Build QualityThe build quality of this case is pretty different compared to the Innocase II that everyone is accustom to. It isn't hard plastic. Instead, it is made from soft silicon and plastic. The case is still two piece like most Seidio products (main piece is silicon, the second piece is a clip on of thin hard plastic that holds the phone and the case tightly around all edges). It also has the rubberized feel that everyone is used to.Upon putting on the case, I held the case in my hand without the phone in it for couple seconds. The texture is definitely nice. It's not like any of those cheap silicon cases that you can get for couple bucks on ebay. It's build to perfection.I loved how they put curvature on the case for where your fingers are. it gives you a sense of security when your holding the phone.Fitment:WOW! Fits perfect. When i mean by fit's perfect, it means that there isn't any space on the inside. It's almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks. It fits tight and smooth. Since the case is silicon, you don't have to worry much about the case on the inside. There's no sliding of individual pieces to put the case on, therefore you don't have to worry about scratching the phone.Seidio also once again did a perfect job when it comes to cutout on the backing and the back cover of the phone. The camera, speaker, and LED are all cut to perfection. Nothing is blocked in anyway. Also you don't have to worry about anything touching the camera lens. Kickstand is also the same. The bottom of the phone also gives easy access to the HDMI and the mini USB port.One thing that I feel weird about is the power button and the volume rocker being covered by silicon. Basically your pressing on the case to access those three buttons. BUT! they did give some embossing for those buttons so you can easily find them with your fingers without looking at the buttons.Protection:There's no possible way to scratching the inside of the casing when you have the phone on the inside. The silicon does a perfect job at this.All edges are protected with silicon and a piece of hard plastic. Silicon is also known to give better protection when the phone drops on the floor. The silicon gives less impact on the phone when dropped.Oh, of course, be sure to use a screen protector.Conclusion:In conclusion, the case lives up to the standard of innovation. They really did make a case that protected the phone real well. The design is slick and they gave a little more design than the standard hard plastic Innocase II. This case gives the phone more of a sports looks, almost like another one of those Marware cases that were made for the iPhone (but the quality of Seidio is much better than Marware).The case is cheaper than the Innocase II. You can buy this Seidio Innocase Active Limited Edition Case from Amazon. They are selling this case for Seidio exclusively. The price is cheaper, but the quality is top of the line. If you love silicon, get this case. If you like hard plastic, get Seidio Innocase II.I do wish that they did something different for this case. I would like to see some other designs and colors. It would be nice to see 2 tone colors (Silicon to be one color and the hard plastic clip on to be another color. This would give it some contrast. (this is personal opinion).Comparison to Innocase II:Size of Active Limited Edition is probably half a millimeter thicker all around. Yes it is a bit bulkier. Both cases are totally different feel. Like I said before, if you like hard case (Seidio Innocase II), if you like Silicon (Active Limited Edition). It would be a hard comparison, but I do like the silicon one better. The only reason is because the inside is more protected. I dont' have to worry about the sliding of hard plastic causing scratches on the bezel of the phone.oh, Innocase Holster doesn't work with this Active Limited Case. This is a big downer. I can't use the holder anymore!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seidio Active Case - Limited Edition", "unixReviewTime": 1277942400, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2010"}

You would have real problems improving on it or finding a better one.The Good:Great (and possibly brilliant) design, engineering and implementationHigh-quality materials, good attention to detailThe Bad:I have large hands and for my personal tastes, they could have made the springs in the clip just a shade stiffer.The Ugly:Not a thingThe main idea with clip holsters is convenience. With most clip holsters, when you need your phone you reach for it, disengage a clip and pull it out. Seidio does this idea one better and then improves on its implementation with several intelligent refinements.First, the Seidio clip-on holster is a 'face-in' design; which means it keeps the touch-screen pointed inwards towards your body and in contact with a piece of velvet-like material to protect it. This idea is so simple and so powerful that you don't know why every holster-maker on the planet hasn't adopted it yet.Your screen is the most delicate, delicate and hard-to-replace part of any smartphone, the Seidio holster treats it that way.Second: most clip holsters require an upwards motion to get your phone into your hand making them hard to use when dressed in winter clothing or business attire. The Seidio Spring-Clip holster eliminates the need for the 'gun-fighter' motion by stabilizing the phone at only three points--at two fixed corners and by the spring-loaded clip that grips the top edge of the phone at an optimally secure angle so that it is stable until the clip is raised.This means that your phone is safely locked into the holster so long as you don't accidentally move the clip or snag it on objects and with a little practice, thumbing the clip and letting the phone drop into your hand for use becomes second nature and you forget you're doing it--as someone who once fed $400 worth of smartphone to a seat in a movie theater and had to buy a new one, I have big reasons to love the Seidio.Third: Most clip-holsters are so badly engineered and so insecure that clerks in stores that sell phones will warn customers away from them saying that they're bound to lose their phones.  This is far less likely with the Seidio than with any other clip-on holster I've ever bought.Unlike other case/holster makers, Seidio makes their holsters using a good, high-strength polymer and they display an attention to detail and quality control that simply makes their product better. The tongue on the end of the clip that secures the holster to your belt has a sharper angle to it than others do; the mechanism that allows you to rotate the holster on your belt to the optimal position for you demonstrates a good, positive lock that you simply don't see elsewhere.All in all, the Seidio Spring-Clip Holster for an uncased Evo 4G has a lot to recommend it. It is my go-to solution for carrying around and maintaining quick access to my phone and keeping it safe. In fact, this review is of the second one I bought for this model: the first was destroyed at my workplace but the phone itself ended up just shy of being pristine. All in all, Seidio can be said to have worked with an all too rare business model: they decided to make money by making something good.*** Update: Sept 1, 2011***Wrecked my third holster--this time while getting into a car and snagging the back end of the clip on the door-frame, breaking the swivel joint that holds the holster to my belt. The phone fell to the ground and was completely unharmed.

It seemed to work okay at first, after a few months I've noticed some problems with it.1. Finicky Communication - Works okay for the first few minutes of the call then unexpectedly cuts off and the caller is left thinking the call was dropped, when in fact there is a problem with the bluetooth connection. Only happens periodically.2. Lack of True Handfree integration (for the Motorola Atrix at least) - I have not been able to interface the bluetooth to make a call through my handset using only my voice. Even though I can start the process with a click to the headset followed by a voice command, I have to go through 2 sub commands before I can make a call. This coupled with the spotty voice recognition makes voice dialing an option I never use.3. Low Mic Volume - I have had multiple people tell me while talking to me that the call volume on their end was low. This, coupled with the experience of owning another bluetooth headset where I didn't have this problem, leads me to beleive it's the Blue Ant's fault.Things I Liked1. Battery Life - Seems to stay solid, even when left in the car and used periodically over the week. I can usually go a week without a charge, this is with light use during the week though.2. A2DP - Being able to stream music and podcasts wirelessly is great, I really like this feature, and it's one that I'll look for in my next headset for sure. Though it does tend to drain the battery.3. Micro USB Charger - Having the same charging port as my phone makes it possible to have only one charging solution in my car, which is very nice.Overall I can't recommend this headset. If you get it at a really good price it would be serviceable, but to pay a premium for it doesn't make sense. I've owned a number of Plantronics bluetooths and most of the problems I've had with this unit have been non-issues with the Plantronics ones. Bottom line, I'm getting a Plantronics to replace this one.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not As Good as It Could Be", "unixReviewTime": 1349481600, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2012"}

We have several headsets in the household: an ancient Motorola bluetooth that's not able to work well in our noisy ScionxB car; the new-ish Motorola H850 started sounding tinny; and a very disappointing performance from the Jawbone Icon.After Googling for \"the bluetooth for Blackberry\" I was faced with a list of brands and models. Some of which I'd heard of Motorola, Jawbone etc. But what of this Blueant? Yes, I'd heard of it, but no one I know has one. But the reviews on Amazon looked fine. After charging the headset I noticed the odd rubber ear piece (like the Jawbone Icon) but luckily an earhook is available to support the gadget. The Blueant is very easy to set up - the voice instructions are like a sci-fi film. And really useful. I paired to Blackberry, then to Samsung Epic (Android) and both tests were great - clear, loud and the noise filtering didn't affect the voice sound too much. If there's background noice Blueant will fade the noice which does affect your voice a bit, but still makes the conversation heard. (Out of curiosity I paired the Jawbone Icon to the Blackberry and that was not so good - the usual reported excessive fading in and out, the rustling sound and cut outs were all apparent.)So, after pairing and unpairing pretty easily and testing on Blackberry and Samsung Epic I am happy to say that this bluetooth might actually live up to its claims. I've just to try it with 22mph winds, but I am glad I've been able to get a great headset for less than $50. Highly recommended. Pity I had to gave this to my lady.

For mine, I can just leave it plugged in all the time, so your mileage may vary.Overall I'm VERY happy with this charger, and glad that I didn't let the warnings discourage me.

{"reviewerID": "A1CBB2CYNLU8O", "asin": "B003PU01M4", "reviewerName": "K. Crawford", "helpful": [80, 84], "reviewText": "A quick summary of this product before I get into the details:Likely great for dedicated Apple device users that has all the power it claims (simultaneously 2.1 Amps on one port with 1 Amp on the other for a total of 3.1 Amps output combined, but under performs DRAMATICALLY for non-Apple devices due to protocol issues for USB chargers.  It gets 3-stars because all it claims to support is Apple devices.Now for more details...A little background on USB charging for those who don't know:The USB power spec is for 0.5 Amps at 5 Volts... or 2.5 Watts.  This was great up until the last couple years when devices have gotten really power hungry, particularly smartphones and tablets and to a lesser extent dedicated GPS's.  Some of these devices use over 2 Amps, particularly the tablets like the iPad (or in my case the HP Touchpad).Manufacturers of these devices therefore had a dilemma.  If they had their devices pull more than 0.5 Amps, they risked damaging the power source, which could be a computer, that was only prepared to source 0.5 Amps.  Thus the manufacturers have used tricks to determine whether their device is connected to an unknown source, at which point they purposely only draw 0.5 Amps, or to the dedicated charger that was provided with the device, where they can draw all the power they need.There seem to be two common tricks used.  The first is to short the two data-wires together in the charger.  This is what most non-Apple devices do.  Since a computer or older device wouldn't have done this, the device can assume it is safe to draw all the power it needs.Apple seems to have taken a different approach, one that I don't fully understand but know can be seen by the fact that the data lines are neither open nor shorted when the charger is plugged in, and is more sophisticated and probably superior, because I suspect it allows the device to know exactly how much power it can use.While Apple taking a better approach might be nice in concept, it's created chaos in the USB charger product category.  What is the non-specific charger to do?  They can't support both.Kensington chose to go the Apple route for the 2.1 Amp port.  I don't own any high-power Apple devices, so I can't say for sure, but I suspect this unit performs well with Apple devices.  Using electronic equipment I was able to draw 2.1 Amps when putting a fixed load on this USB charging port.  However, when I connect any of the 3 high-power devices I have (HP Touchpad (2 Amps), Motorola Triumph Android phone (0.85 Amps) and the LG Optimus Slider (0.7 Amps)), none of them drew all the current they could have, because they were expecting a shorted set of data-lines.The 1 Amp port on this device is a bit of a quandry however.  It didn't have the signature on the data lines of either the Apple protocol or the shorted lines.  It appeared to have them open... which was a surprise and I believe a mistake (although I can't be certain with Apple products).  The results for my 3 devices however were identical to that of the 2.1 Amp port.To highlight the positives, I can say this, I was able to draw all the power the product claims it can source using fixed loads.  As my above explanation makes clear, it is the DEVICE, not the charger, that chooses not to make full use of the available current (Amps).  So by using power resistors I could test the actual capacity of the device without dealing with the data-line issue.As such, I was able to draw both 2.1 Amps from one port and 1 Amp from the other, simultaneously.  I can not say the same for the other charger I have tried (and I have two in shipment to test).Thus this device gets 3 stars because it only claims to support Apple devices and without any to test I have to assume it would work great for them.  It also can deliver the current it claims.  It is likely a 5-star product for sole apple users.However, for non-Apple users, I STRONGLY encourage you to look elsewhere for your Car USB power needs.  The other device I've tried is the \"PowerGen Dual USB 2A Heavy Duty Ouput Car Charger\" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00622AG6S/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details).  It has other problems (the 2A port doesn't have the data lines shorted and it only sources a TOTAL of 2A, not 2A on one port and 1A on the other), but at least one port (the 1A, which can really do 2A by itself, see my review over there for more details on that) on that has the data lines shorted to get the full power with non-Apple devices.I've ordered two additional devices:- \"Ultra Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 2.1A Output\" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00470C35E/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details)- \"Bracketron Universal Dual USB Car Adapter (UGC-298-BL)\" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056VNVV8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details)Hopefully one of the two of them will be able to deliver to their specs for my devices.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Only for Apple devices", "unixReviewTime": 1327708800, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2012"}

It's a no brainer! Kensington at \"no-name\" pricing, dual power slots at \"single slot\" pricing, 10 watts at 5 watt pricing. It's sold direct by Amazon, not by a 3rd party vendor closing out on over-stock.Did I mention it came with an original style cable, which seems sturdier than the Apple which is prone to fraying at the juncture with the connectors themselves?So I dutifully come back here on December 24, 2012,  to review it, and suddenly it is $24.96! Not a buck or two more expensive, almost THREE TIMES as expensive.Now at $9.99, that's a cheap price for a name-brand cable, let alone for a dual slot power supply, with one of them delivering the full 10 watts preferred by the old iPad 3. But at $24.96 the decision is much tougher - go with this one, or with a no-name for half the price? Do I really need an extra cable (at this higher price), or would a no-name without a cable be ok? What about a no-name that is reviewed as being able to deliver 10 watts but only if the other slot is unused? What about a no-name that can only deliver 5 watts, enough for my phone but not for an iPad? See, I got the first class, feature-rich charger, WITH cable, for a stripped, generic device price. Yay! But - why the pricing difference? Is it still worth it?See, products don't have \"absolute\" value. They have value relative to their price.The new model of online pricing - varying prices daily, or even hourly - is making it really hard to shop.This isn't limited to Amazon, the NY Times did an article this holiday season about how Target, Best Buy, and WalMart, among others, varied prices day by day this holiday season, post-Black Friday, to match or beat their competition, and which store had the most consistently low prices - which wasn't consistent across all products. I just read an article that another retailer, Staples, even delivers different online pricing depending on your zip code and nearness to one of their identified competitors, like Office Depot.So this review is a little different from my other product reviews, and different from the other product reviews of this particular product.For the best insights on performance of this product, read the two top-rated reviews here - I believe those two are honest, objective, and insightful. The only thing I would add, is that I have three Apple cables that are frayed at the junction with the actual connector - the flex portion wasn't well-designed. From the looks of it, the flex portion on the Kensington cable is longer and thicker - which should extend the cable life at this critical juncture where more stresses occur. The first top rated reviewer has actually used this for over two years and reports that, yes, the Kensington included cable does last longer, so that is a nice bonus. Secondly, and don't laugh, now that Apple has released the new Lightning Connector, I like the fact that Kensington departed from \"Apple white\" to make their connector in black - why? - because it's a lot quicker to grab the right device cable when black means old style and white means Lightning. Yes, this comes up, since I have devices with both styles of connectors and travel with both. It's just one less thing to be annoyed by, when trying to charge them.In terms of pricing strategies, good grief, stay on your toes! Amazon USUALLY has very competitive prices, if not the best, but now more than ever it pays to comparison shop, even to open an \"Incognito\" browser tabe in Chrome to see if searching cookie-free returns different pricing. Above all, comparison shop, and if you don't like the prices today, bide your time, and post buying, monitor the prices for the first month so you can ask for a price adjustment if things get out of whack.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "At 9.99 a steal.

Not only can you charge an iPad at full power with the thing, but the secondary port outputs 1A which will charge your phone faster than usual.

Having your devices too low on power when you get out of the car is really not fun, especially when they're drained before you can even make it back to the car. Two high power USB ports in one cigar outlet is a major advantage because most people don't have more than one or maybe two cigar outlets in their car. Even if you don't normally need two USB power ports, trust me... you will be happy you have the extra one day when you do need to plug something else in.

When properly applied, they were awesome: crystal clear, completely stationary (no sliding, no peeling, no emerging bubbles), and shock resistant.The iPhone 4 era InvisibleSHIELD, however, suffers from a serious manufacturing defect: roller lines. The machine rollers in their manufacturing process are leaving perfectly straight vertical lines on InvisibleSHIELDs coming off the line these days. You won't notice it at first; it will only become apparent once the shield has had 24 hours to dry and the bubbles have all disappeared.You will then find perfectly straight, well-defined \"rainbow lines\" on the shield that refract light, particularly when your phone is showing a white screen. By holding the phone and shield up to light and turning them back and forth to see the protected screen at different angles, you will notice that there is a line running the length of the shield from rollers during manufacturing.I have always applied InvisibleSHIELD protectors for family and friends and can do a perfect job each time and every time. This is not installation error; you can hold a ruler against the lines and see that they are perfectly straight and of precise width.Of the six iPhone 4 protectors I've installed from Zagg, FOUR have had \"rainbow lines\" in them, one of them with TWO perfectly straight parallel \"rainbow lines\" running the length of the screen about a centimeter apart. (Search Google for the term \"rainbow lines\"; it's a well-known problem.) Zagg won't honor their lifetime warranty for affected protectors, instead saying it's a normal artifact of their manufacturing process (while some other reps will just tell you you've done a lousy job installing the protector).So now it's \"normal\" for Zagg InvisibleSHIELD users to have prominent lines that look like screen defects running vertically across the screens of their iPhones. So much for \"invisible.\"In fact, they're extremely distracting and I'm currently looking for a similar wet-applied, soft-protector alternative that has better quality control.Until Zagg acknowledges and fixes this quality control problem, I can't recommend dropping $20 on a product that will leave you wishing you could still read your pristine iPhone screen.

So I went to my local Best Buy yesterday and I picked on up, and installed it with no issues.  Only problem with mine is, its not 100% centered and the home button is a little bit harder to press but no big deal... screen is the most important part to protect.  I read on here that there are some who say that you can see the film and degrades the screen quality.  I can only see the screen protector when the screen is off.  When I am doing something on the phone, I don't even notice its there.  Touch quality is just as good, maybe a little worse than no screen protector but still, protection is important.Overall I am very happy with this screen protector.

Next step is to align the screens to the surface. After this is done, you use a squegee that is supplied to remove all bubbles and imperfections that are the result of the bonding process. Rub, rub, rub with that squegee and eventually you are done. The only maintance that is performed is a periodic once over with a lint free rag to keep it clean and pretty.The sields won't go anywhere and it offers great protection in the most vulnerable areas on your phone.This is a good product and a smart investment for a pricey electronic device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Offers Great Surface Protection", "unixReviewTime": 1315958400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2011"}

It is good for getting a good grip on the slippery phone. There is not much protection from dropping.I had bad luck with the screen protector -- just kept getting dust underneath, and it looked bad, so now I use it without the screen protector. Maybe I will buy some other protectors and try my luck again.I got a free Apple \"bumper\" case, but none of my non-Apple headphone plugs or multipin adapters will go through the case holes (such as the iGo car power adapter), as they are slightly bigger than the openings. On this case the holes are big enough, and the case is thin enough, that all my non-Apple plugs fit so far.They could have cut an opening on the back for the Apple logo, for appearance sake, as Elago did on its series of cases for the iPhone 3G.Be careful putting it on and taking it off. The buttons and silence switch can catch on the case openings, and I don't think you want to apply much sideways force to them. Just bending the sides slightly when putting it on or taking it off takes care of this. I find this a little tricky and I don't think this is a case you want to be putting on and taking off a lot.After several weeks I now see bit of the rubbery/textured-paint coating rubbing off on the edges where I put the phone face down on a surface, showing the black plastic underneath. It is not easy to see and functionally I do not think it is significant.When using the phone for turn-by-turn navigation in a car, it warms up quite a bit.

Ali \"Relentless Pursuit of Technology\"", "helpful": [98, 103], "reviewText": "I have owned the iphone 3GS and now the iphone 4. Between the 2 I have purchased 3 different cases for the iphone 3GS and this is my second case for the iphone 4 (I also have the Apple bumper). The cost of the various cases I have bought have ranged from $20-$50. Here is my basic impression of how the Sonix case stacks up:1. Build quality: This is a very thin and lightweight case. If you want a case that will protect your phone from drops, the Apple bumper may be a better choice. In fact I did drop the phone with the bumper and there were no scratches. Zero. Haven't had an accident with this one, but it's a nice quality case, with a very nice grip but it's main function is to protect the phone from nicks and bruises in daily use. I have switched to using this as my default case.2. Design: This is the best 'looking' case I have ever owned! It is very slim and light and compliments the iphone 4 beautifully. Whereas with the Apple bumper you completely lose the metal looks of this band, this one keeps enough highlights of the aluminium band that the phone does not lose any of its attractiveness. With ANY other phone I would not care about cloaking the phone in a case, but the iphone 4 is a thing of beauty! You just need to see it and hold it to know what I mean. This case is unique because it does NOT change either the balance or the looks of the phone. It compliments it very well.3. Impact on antenna issue: Frankly I have had no dropped calls with my iphone 4. It is better than my iphone 3gs in very way in terms of call quality. In fact I was in the Outer Banks recently and  while my wife Sony Ericsson C902 phone had a hard time keeping a signal for a call, the iphone 4 had no issues. I do have the issue where the bars will drop when you hold the phone a certain way, but it has no impact on my call quality. This case, like the bumper helps in not dropping the bars compared to holding the phone, but it does not help or degrade the call quality. So, if you are looking to get this case to help with call quality I am afraid my experience in both the Washington DC area and the outer banks and places in between says it won't help or hurt...4. Value: At $19.99 this is a no brainer really. You get the best looking case that is very functional and elegant. I don't really use the screen protector. The screen on the iphone 4 is already pretty glare resistant -  more so than the 3GS, so the screen protector can help with scratches but not for glare. For what it's worth I used my iphone 4 as a GPS for our trip to the outer banks. The screen on the iphone 4 was completely readable even in the brightest and direct sun light. The screen on the iphone 4 is fantastic and covering it up with a protector doesn't seem like a good idea (to me at least).Overall, I am really happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply the best!", "unixReviewTime": 1278374400, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2010"}

I've been using them for about 3 months now to transfer data and music to and from my htc EVO 4G.As for charging, I can't say I've had much experience using this cable to charge the phone. If I had to guess, I'd say it doesn't charge well via USB from any pc, or even from a car/home usb adapter charger.

As soon as they arrived I used them to unlock the screen.  It worked, so I tested it with the Swype keyboard, dragging over letters instead of tapping.  No problem.  I fired up a game and realized what a hard time I'd been having before with my fumble fingers.These aren't precision instruments.  The tip is rounded and soft, so if hitting an exact pixel is important, you probably don't want these.  They're more precise than my fingertip, at least.  They're quite short, just barely long enough to fit in my hand if I hold it like a pencil.  (My hands are a women's medium--if you've got XL hands you might have a hard time with it.)  They're very lightweight and probably hollow, so if you like writing utensils with heft look elsewhere.They do work on my phone.  There are three of them, so I can leave a couple where I normally would need them and have a spare for when I lose one.  And they're pretty darn cheap.  Good enough for me.9/19/11 update: I liked these enough (and they're cheap enough) that I ordered two more sets.  I know I'll lose some, so this way I'll have spares on hand.  Now that I've got nine to try out, I'm starting to see the problems others are having.Of the nine, six are OK.  They've been scattered around the house so one is always handy no matter where I am.  Two are fantastic--they work with a feather touch.  I put those in places where I do critically important work.  (*COUGH*games*COUGH*)  One stylus is terrible.  It requires a lot of pressure just to tap, and sometimes even that isn't good enough.  Forget dragging.  I have to press so hard I'd be afraid the tip would pop off.  It has been strategically placed in the trash can.But these things are so cheap that one bad stylus out of nine isn't enough to make me regret buying them.

However, the texture *does* make the back of the phone easier to hold onto.If you want something that'll make the back of your phone easier to hold onto and grip, that will get rid of the slippery feeling of the bare iPhone, and will protect the back of your phone from scratches without changing the look of your phone much, then grab this and just apply the back portion.

I,ve applied the invisishield to all my kids iphone 3g's and mine and was very pleased with them. They took a beating before they showed any signs of wear. Not with this iphone 4 shield. I applied the full body protection to both my iphone 4 and my son's. They went on easy, no bubbles, the problem is the adhesive is obviously not string enough or never dries. Whatever the reason, they silde off with the slightest movement. Forget about putting the phone in your pocket or a case, because the shield will peel right off.Now for the sad part. It seems Zagg is following in Apples foot steps claiming there is no problem with the shield, and blame it on applying error. That is just BS. Sure they'll replace it for free, but you have to pay for the shipping, packaging, gas and time to take it to the shipper, etc. In other words, they know they're getting very few back. The cost to produce these has to be next to nothing when you poduce in the volume they do. They can easily send you a replacement free without any of the above hassles.While they did respond to my e-mail, because like another reviewer said, you won't get them on the phone, they agreed to a ONE TIME REPLACEMENT!, providing I followed the above procedure.

And yes, you must have your phone off because you are going to be squeegeeing the solution out. I use a tissue pushed into the speaker hole to prevent solution from getting in.The scratch resistance of this thing is remarkable. I have been able to keep one of these on for much longer than other screen protectors. Also, it has a LIFETIME warranty. You pay only shipping each time you want to replace with a new one.I agree that there is a very slight waviness in the surface of the shield, but it does not affect the clarity of the screen.I agree that it is not as slippery as the glass screen, but I found that wiping the surface against my cotton shirt or pants has made it much smoother in just a few days.I purchased the custom back with a family photo printed into the shield. It really customizes the phone.One downside about the fit, is that Zagg has made it so precise to fit right up to the edges of the phone, that when I installed the Apple bumper onto it, it was really tricky to get the bumper to settle down on top of the edge of the shield. Squeezing the bumper sometimes puts a slight bubble on the edge that I have to push down periodically.All in all, I like this screen protector, and I like the idea that I can continually get more for shipping charges only as the screen becomes worn.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better than what other reviewers are saying", "unixReviewTime": 1279238400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2010"}

I will leave my iPhone in the other room and venture off while talking and have no interruptions. The distance is awesome. The sound quality is awesome as well. I have talked to people on the phone and they had no idea I was on a headset. I even rolled my window down going 50 mph and my buddy said it still sounded great, no wind noise.

I bought it to replace the Invisible Shield style product that I got from gadgetshieldz because I had ripped it (I don't even know how). While this is cheaper, the gadgetshieldz is a full body shield. I left on the rest of that, and only replaced the protector covering the screen.Comparing the two, this screen is a hard, slippery plastic (rather than the rubbery material that the gadgetshieldz is made out of). I don't expect it to last as long or be as scratch resistant, but I did get 3 of them. Which brings me to my next point: one of them was damaged/not perfect. At a quarter a pop, I don't really care.The product comes with no application instructions and a polyester cloth that removes your fingerprints, but will be sure to leave a mess of cloth fibers in its place. Don't use it. Use a microfiber cloth, of even your cotton t-shirt. Anything is better. Just make sure that all fingerprints and dust are gone before application.To apply this product, I followed the same wet application instructions that I used for my gadgetshieldz. Just grab a plate, put a couple drops of dish soap and clean water in it. Make sure the solution is well mixed (mix it with your finger). The solution should be soapy, but not bubbly. If there are suds, you used too much soap. All we are trying to do here is make the solution somewhat sticky.Then remove the protective backing on the shield, and dunk it in the solution (totally immerse it). Plop the shield on your phone now and arrange it till it is perfect. Take of any excess water (rearranging it if needed), and leave it be overnight. If you mess up at any point, you can simply lift up the protector, dunk it in the solution again, and start over. When you come back the next day, it'll be set enough for you to use. Just peel off the front backing, and you are good to go.There is pretty much no risk of damaging your phone, but if you want to be extra careful, you can turn it off and remove the battery.To those that complain of bubbles: ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS WILL HAVE BUBBLES UPON INITIAL INSTALLATION. Over the next couple of days, the bubbles will go away.If I could do this again, I would just get a gadgetshieldz instead. While this product is nice, it is too slippery, attracts fingerprints, has too much glare, and won't last as long. If you want a shield that you can just set and forget for the next year or two, then get something else.

I have ordered screen protectors in the past for GPS, MP3 player & other products & I always got a paper thin product that corners started to curl up in a couple of days, but not this time.Be careful where you buy it from. Mine came from importer520 Amazon seller. They were very quick to ship me a product with high quality. The 3 protectors individually wrapped & secured inside a plastic bag & each protector again is protected by another thin sheet on both side that can be peeled off later (One side should be taken off before the application & another side after the application to the screen. The protectors are thick & very crystal clear. After the application, hardly I can see the protector, unless I look close to the edges.But the biggest challenge is 1) to get the dust away & 2) place precisely on the screen. First time, I missed by 1mm on the left hand side of my HTC EVO screen & 2nd try, 2 small piece of dust slipped through under the protector, creating bubbles. Now 2 already in the trash, but got the last one almost right in place with on small piece of dust slipped through again. Still happy, since the same protector at Sprint store cost almost $10.00.Be aware that this protector covers the front camera, but I can't see any effect on the picture quality of front camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Crystal Clear Protection + Good thickness", "unixReviewTime": 1293235200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2010"}

My iPhone 4 slides in perfectly and fits snuggly in the armband, the armband is too small for upper arm, but I do wear it on my lower arm (it will fit on my upper arm, but it is super tight, so I wear it just below the elbow, which makes it easier to see anyway).  The iPhone is snug against the plastic cover and I can interact with the entire phone while it is in there.  The Velcro holds on tight and I have not had any problems.  The material the armband is made out of is comfy and does not rub the skin.  The top of the iPhone is completely visible through the top opening, so this is not completely waterproof, but it makes it easier to get it in and out and to plug in headphones without having to line up a hole.  The material is always soaked after exercising from sweat, and feels like a sponge (I assume the sponge feeling helps the arm breathe), however,  the iPhone is perfectly dry and when you put your finger in the iPhone opening you can not feel any moisture inside the enclosing.  The clear plastic had a few scratches on it (nothing large but it looks like a small scuff), I think it is mainly through the window that allows you to feel the armband before you buy on the packaging.  However, it was not large and is hardly noticeable.In the end I am very pleased with this armband, it fits comfortably and is completely controllable from which the armband, if you give the iPhone a second to adjust the brightness (if enabled in settings) you do not have much glare and can see the screen nicely even in the sun).

My old iPhone 3GS armband was worn out and didn't hold the 4 very well.  I researched armbands at various exercise/running sites and most people liked the Fast Fit.  I found Amazon had the best price so I made the purchase.My initial impression was that the product is well-made, sturdy, and would not be affected by sweat, rain, or heat.  The armband is a vinyl-like material that doesn't stretch.  You need to find a good size setting to prevent the armband from sliding down your arm during a run but not so tight as to cut off circulation to your arm.  So far, this has been my biggest complaint with this product.  I can't find a good medium between holding the phone secure on my arm and my arm turning blue.  I find I'm accepting of a little arm slippage rather than arm tingling and blood supply cut-off.The other minor item is the velcro connector that holds the phone in place.  The phone is inserted from the bottom of the holder.  There's a velcro strap that's about 1.5 inches wide that wraps from the front of the phone to the back.  You can see in some of the product pictures that this holder sticks out a little, about 1/4 inch.  It holds the phone securely in the pouch, but it also rubs on your arm with every step, causing slight discomfort.  Shirt sleeves lessen this discomfort but don't eliminate it.You can't use a case with this pouch, at least not initially.  I have a very minimalist case from CaseMate, very thin and form-fitting around the phone, and I can't use it with this armband.  The phone pouch is still too tight and the iPhone doesn't slid in or out very well with the case on.  I'm hoping the pouch will stretch a little with time and use.  Until then, I have to remove the case prior to inserting the iPhone.  The plastic screen cover is a bit touchy to use, it doesn't always register finger presses/swipes, but once I start an exercise, I don't usually touch the screen again until I'm finished.  So that item doesn't bother me.  If you find yourself using the screen often, it will take some time getting used to.Apart from those issues, I'm pleased with the buckle system, it goes on and off quickly.  The cord holder is nice touch if you have dedicated headphones; I don't so I don't use it.  Based on my first impressions and the price I paid, I'll keep using this armband at least through the summer to see how it holds up.UPDATE 6/24/11:  I've used this armband for several weeks now.  My initial impressions remain the same but I have found increasing displeasure with the armband slipping down my arm as I run.  As I mentioned in my review, the strap is not elastic so it's difficult to find a comfortable setting for keeping the armband in one place above my bicep while at the same time not cutting off the circulation to my arm!  The longer I run and the more I sweat, the more apt the armband is to slide down.  I still haven't found a comfortable adjustment yet, but I keep trying.  Other than that, the case keeps my iPhone dry when I'm running and it starts to rain and the plastic screen cover, though it attracts a lot of finger smudges, accurately tracks my finger across the screen.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good attempt, but a few flaws hold it back", "unixReviewTime": 1307059200, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2011"}

I've never used such a contraption before and my other half purchased the Belkin DualFit armband, so I've been trying it out.The Belkin DualFit armband, weighing 1.5 ounces, is a simple lightweight device used to store an iphone on your arm.  The hand washable armband is sized by a Velcro strap and two slots.  A larger enclosure holds the iPhone securely in place and fully covered.  A clear plastic sheet encircled by a reflective strip protects the front of the iPhone while allowing the user to see and use the encased iPhone.  A small pocket next to the larger water resistant enclosure is large enough to hold a house key or excess earphone wire.There seems to be confusion about how to use the DualFit armband.  When I first saw the armband, I thought I was to thread the strap through the inner slot, and loop it back through the outer slot.  This just seems logical; however this method will size the armband between 9 to 11 inches.  For larger arms, one should thread through the outer slot (as shown in the product image) which allows sizing between 11 and 15 inches.  My initial confusion and comments from others indicates Belkin does a poor job of explaining how their product works.The iPhone 4 fits in the DualFit's larger enclosure, but doesn't fit snugly.  This is more of a visual issue than anything else.  The iPhone4 is still protected from the weather, and fully functional.I haven't bought my own armband yet, as sharing hasn't been a problem for us.  When it becomes a problem, I will definitely consider purchasing this armband.

There is plenty of room for adjusting the band as its mostly velcro so you can get the fit you desire. The fabric is neoprene and as another reviewer mentioned, it is a sweat absorber. This is another issue because now that your phone isn't in a case, the back of the armband is very thin stretchy neoprene and the back of my phone was wet from my arm sweating.I paid way too much for my iPhone to have to worry about it getting wet with sweat and possible damage and then being stinky. I'll have to find another armband that has enough room to allow a phone with a case.

It is impossible to put your iPhone into it if you use any kind of case, no matter now thin and slim. That means you need to remove your iPhone from its case to use this.Once you put the iPhone in, there is no way to easily remove it from the sleeve unless you take the armband off. It is just too snug to remove the iPhone with the armband on.While this does mean your iPhone is very secure while running, it also means that if you want to use your iPhone at anytime during your run (such as to answer a phone call, send an email, etc.) it is not convenient to do so.2. My arms are not particularly large, and I had no trouble adjusting this. However, I do note that the velcro is glued rather than stitched, which means that eventually it will start peeling.3. The material for this armband does not breathe at all. Therefore this armband becomes very uncomfortable to wear while running outside in hot humid weather or on the treadmill at my gym as the sweat builds up.Bottom line: For running I will continue to keep my iPhone 4S either in a Spibelt waist pack or Amphipod Microstretch waist pack (both of which I have reviewed on Amazon). Both of those breathe, it is easy to take my iPhone in and out even with its case on, and both hold it securely.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "There are better products for runners", "unixReviewTime": 1340668800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2012"}

I do not own an iPhone but my Galaxy S Blaze is a similar size, so I thought that it might work. Unfortunately the fit was a little too snug and the unlock and volume buttons kept getting pressed. Obviously this armband isn't made for my phone so I cannot fault it for that.The armband itself is easy to adjust. It fits snug and did not become lose or uncomfortable while I was jogging. The little pocket for your house key is a nice addition and worked well. The screen was easy to see and control while it was within the armband and the phone itself was free of sweat/moisture after my workout was finished. The velcro that other reviewers have complained about, gave me no issues. I've only used this during 3 workout sessions though, so I can't attest to how well it holds up over prolonged use. I've noticed no signs of adhesive deterioration or any other issues with the velcro though.For $20 this is a well designed, nice looking, armband for your iPhone (or other device of similar size.). I'm sure there are much more sophisticated, higher quality, armbands out there. But, with this, you're getting an average armband for an average price. As I stated, I had no issues with the velcro separating from the rest of the armband, but I have not used this extensively.

It fits snug, has a slot for your house/car key (not a keyfob), and seurely holds the iPhone or iPod Touch (no room for a bumper; just the device). It is pretty bright in color. Not my favorite color, but it makes it difficult to lose. The screen protector is not as smooth as glass, but does not negatively impact the touch screen usage.Some are complaining that it is only for those with larger arms. It should fit most arms. While the description says it fits 12.6\" to 15.8\", the one I received seems to more realistically fit 10\" to 15\" arms. Here is a  trick for those that pick this up and can't get it to fit smaller arms. This is difficult to explain in words, so hoping it is clear. With this armband, you typically slip the strap through a slot on the opposite side, and then wrap the strap back around to stick the velcro. If you have smaller arms than this permits, you can slip the strap farther through the slot, and just fold the strap and stick the velcro on the outside of the slot. So instead of wrapping the strap around the slot and attaching the velcro, just fold it and attach it on the other side of the slot than normal. You'll have a little loop of the strap dangling, but at least it will fit snug. With this method, you could get it to fit tiny arms.We do wish it had more of a lip at the top to cover the iPhone, so the top of the device has at least some mediocre protection from the elements (e.g., water/sweat trickling down the arm). The back of the armband pocket can get moist too, which also means the back of your device will get wet too. Not sure why Belkin did not add a plastic liner to the back of the pocket, I guess we could add our own plastic back out of a sandwich bag or something, but it definitely seems like an oversight.In addition, we've had some issues with Belkin's armbands in the past where the glued seams do not last long. This armband has similar seams, so we are hoping we don't have similar issues. So far, all is well. Just be careful inserting your device. Don't stretch the seams too much. Be careful with the velcro strips too. Easy does it.In any event, it is a worthy armband and we'll keep using it and abusing it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It will match your bright pants", "unixReviewTime": 1342483200, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2012"}

I used wet solution included with another screen protector.  However, you can make your own by adding a tiny bit of mild soap (unscented, uncolored) to deionized water (buy some distilled water from the grocery store) and putting it in a spray applicator.  You can read instructions on the wet application method elsewhere online.  But by application a liberal amount of solution to the screen and the iPhone, you can slide the protector for a few seconds to position it properly before it adheres.

These protectors would also be good for use on an iPhone if the thickness of an Otter case will not fit into your method of carry.

The price is certainly good, to the point where I'm not even sure how they can get them to my door for the amount of money paid, much less manufacture and package them. I'm pretty sure these are drop-shipped direct from China, because mine took about four weeks to arrive. (And speaking of dropping, I dropped my phone twice in that span - you might want to order ahead if you know you're going to be getting an iPhone and decide to purchase these covers. But, keep reading.) The instructions for application were cryptic at best, but once I figured out how to remove the plastic sheets from the cover on both sides, I was okay. The lint-free cloth provided, however, did not do a very good job. I screwed up my first cover by pulling off the plastic too soon. The second one had too many dust particles and a bunch of bubbles. The third one was serviceable, but it wasn't completely sticky at the bottom. After about two months, the non-adhesion area grew to about one-third of the surface of the phone. I pulled it off and went withBelkin Clear Screen Protector for Apple iPhone 4S (3 Pack). If you get lucky and get a sticky cover and get the dust off your phone, these will probably work. Still, you'll have to get lucky, so I would say if you're a gambler and don't mind waiting a month for your product to arrive, these are fine or at least, give good cost performance. Otherwise, try the Belkin or something else.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for...eventually", "unixReviewTime": 1331510400, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2012"}

I intend to buy a better case eventually, when I have more time to review and try some out in store. But I wanted it to be protected short term while I looked around. Because of the price, I anticipated something junky, but mildly effective in the short term. So it arrived today, on-time, and I am pleasantly surprised. This crystal clear case fits like a glove, barely increases the size of the phone and seems pretty durable. It's also pretty nice looking. The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is because the case doesn't wrap around the phone far enough to prevent the face of the phone from contacting a surface if laid down flat on it. But if this isn't a big deal, then by all means, this is a nice little case.As a side note, I upgraded from a 3GS phone. When I first got the phone, I protected it like it was a fragile piece of art. But after about 6 months, I stopped using a protective film, since it was hard to keep it from bubbling and it softened the look of the display. I kept it unprotected for a year, and through normal wear and tear, it had never had a scratch on it. The new iPhone 4 display is supposed to be much more durable and hardened, so I'm not going to bother covering the display, but I will not tempt fate either. No coins or loose keys in the same pocket as my phone!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pleasantly surprised", "unixReviewTime": 1293580800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2010"}

I was running a $9 version that I was unhappy with. I guess you get what you pay for. The stock battery would charge from empty in about an hour and a half. The old extended life battery took about two and a half hours. This battery took a little over five hour last night, and it wasn't fully discharged when I plugged it in.

I unplugged the phone at 6am and it is about 10pm now and I'm still at 60%  seems to be about twice the capacity of my old battery. I bought it along with the clip case and I'm also quite happy with that so far. The clip almost doubles the size of the phone, but its an EVO.

On the second day.  37hours 45 minutes!  that is easily twice the runtime I was getting out of my old \"extended life\" battery and almost 3 times the stock battery.  I was again today running my bluetooth all day, streaming pandora, and using the phone for about 30 emails, 10 texts, and almost 2 dozen phone calls.  I am blown away at the increase in performance.  Now Sprint needs to start shipping the phone with this battery as an upgrade at least if not just the factory battery.Second opinion on the case : not sure I will keep using it.  its HUGE and the part that catches the clip is rubber.  I've had a lot of bad luck with the clip poking in between the rubber and the phone.  It holds the phone fine that way, no dropping the phone to complain about.

Everyone knows the Evo battery is dead within eight hours with normal usage.  In the morning, when I take it off the charger, it's down to 80% before I get to the office with just basic usage.  Throw in calls and 4G and some emails and the phone is getting hammered.  The 3500 mAh battery is what the phone was designed for, and vice versa.  My battery monitor tells me I have an estimated 18 hours of use at 85% charge - before this, my monitor was never able to estimate more than nine hours usage!  Truly a huge improvement.Now's the time to get this battery, too.  A couple months ago it was nearly $70 - now it's less than $50.  Quite frankly, Sprint and HTC should be offering this battery as some kind of upgrade when you buy the phone for like another $25.  Selling the Evo with the stock battery makes no sense.  This is a monster phone with speed and brains and extended capabilities - it's needs juice and the stock battery is not up to the task.One thing to keep in mind when you get this thing is that it's not at full capacity right away.  You do have to charge it a few times, use it, charge it again and use it.  After a couple days you'll notice your battery monitor reporting the proper estimated usage.  Even the documentation mentions charging the battery completely a few times to get the max capacity out of it.Another thing is there aren't any other third party cases out there for this size battery.  Pretty much gonna have to use this thing naked when you get it, unless you want that expensive case Seidio sells for the extended battery.Recommended!UPDATE:I am using Batteryminder 2.7 for the phone - even though it's the best app Ive found for what I want - I hate the widgets - I am not sure it's reading the new battery as precisely as it could.

The battery door is more difficult to remove than the stock...it's a very good nice tight fit and I don't think it's going anywhere.  It also has a rubbery feel so it doesn't make you feel like the phone is going to slip out of your hands.  The edges of the door come out on 3 sides around the camera so the camera is also protected when you set the phone down on the back.At first the battery didn't last noticeably longer than stock but after a few recharges I noticed a pretty good increase in the life.  I bought this a little over 3 months ago and didn't write any review then. The reason I'm writing now is because the battery cover is starting to wear down.  What's happening is the rubber-like texture on the back is wearing down to a slick plastic. It started with the edges but now it's getting to the point where every time I remove it from my pocket there are tiny bits of that rubber-like material all over the back of the phone.  It's pretty annoying and will get to the point where I'll just have to scrape it all off.As far as weight goes, it's already a pretty beefy phone so what's a couple extra ounces??Other than that this battery and door set is awesome and serves its purpose well!  I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for longer battery life.If you can get a case to fit over the the phone while the extended battery is installed (Seidio makes this as well) then put that entire fitting in your pocket or on a holster, it would most likely protect the condition and extend the life of the battery door.

Please don't take this wrong, the phone is AMAZING, its ahead of its time (and that in turn is its main problem).  The batteries today just cannot power such a powerful phone.  Why should I have to power off Bluetooth, 4G, screen brightness, etc to make the phone last longer?  Doesn't that take away from the use of the phone.To preface, the battery DOES help.  It makes the phone look ridiculous, but it helps greatly.  On standby, this battery works great so long as the phone doesn't heat up.When I realized the battery couldn't handle the phone:On a trip about 2 hours away, I used it to listen to music stored on the phone (not Pandora) had 4G off, Bluetooth off, and GPS & WiFi on.  About an hour or so into the trip, the phone had dropped to 43% (we left at 6:30 and by 8:00 the phone's battery was more than 1/2 drained).

I have their earlier, lower capacity extended battery and didn't think it offered much, if any, better performance than the stock Evo 4G battery. With earlier HTC phones, I noticed the same thing.I gave this battery its first real workout on an out-of-town trip on which I was constantly using data and voice. It worked well. At the end of a long, hard day, the Seidio Innocell 3500 mAh Extended-Life Battery was showing about 40% capacity remaining. My regular and lower capacity Seidio batteries would have been dead earlier in the day.So, for the moment, I am moderately pleased with this product. Still need to work it hard for a few days with playing videos, streaming music  and such to give it a real workout, but so far, so good.The extended battery door  feels a little on the flimsy side. It ss surprisingly difficult to remove and I was afraid I'd snap off the two retaining pins at the bottom. So far I haven't, but I suspect it won't be long before I do.As it is with most Seidio products, I feel that this battery is overpriced, especially when you look at other lesser-name vendors.

This battery will last approx 2.5-4 times as long as the default battery. I do not know how people claim to be getting days of use out of it, I can squeeze a day of decent use out of it.  This is all I needed it to do since I charge at night anyway.Some things to note for battery life - I've been told by Seido online tech support (the chat client) to just charge it and not let the thing discharge completely, that the thing has no \"memory\" so, that combined with what other people say, do as you will.Charge the thing up 8 hours if you can to begin with.Learn some battery-saving tips that are counter-intuitive3g data transfer seems to take the most juice by far (of my tests)turn on wifi if you have it available.  Data going over wifi uses much less power than data over 3g (transmittiing 50 feet as opposed to a quarter mile). If you're not doing email synch and downloading stuff and syncing with FB/Twitter you can probably leave it off.turn off automatic task-killers - they don't help.  I suggest you do have a task killer, but it not be running.  Most programs behave in the background and unless you root your phone you're not going to be able to remove the sprint bloatware.4G - no idea, I cant tell if it drains the battery significantly or not - I pay $10 extra a month for 1 bar of 4g that goes out when the wind blows.GPS - leave it on, leave it off, you're not going to notice any difference except when a program needs GPS coordinates.Haptic feedback (vibrating when you press a key) - turn it off for texting - if you don't know if you pressed the key or not by looking at the screen it's probably not helping you much anyway.  I do not know how much juice this saves, but that's a little motor that spins to vibrate your phone, gotta be something.With wifi off, 4g off, gps off and playing around - movies, angry birds, word feud, texting, twitter, email sync, I get about 12 hours before I notice the thing's in the 20's.With GPS on, wifi on, 4g off (it really sucks in my area so no reason to have it on), a 5 minute call every hour or so, tweeting, facebook, email sync, couple of youtube videos I get an average battery drain or 4% per hour. or roughly 25 hours of use.Your mileage may vary, I would love to know how to get the battery life the #1 reviewer has - I turned everything off, even airplane mode pulls ~3% an hour which is nowhere near the days worth of life claimed.For the record I've tried auto task killers, they seem to help when the thing is sluggish, but not help any on the battery.  I've tried Juiceminder, which gave me ~20% more battery but no longer works (for me, probably will for you - long fun story) and was causing the phone to be sluggish for 30 seconds after waking up (it was worth it).So yeah, I'm leaving GPS and wifi on all the time when I'm at home or work and not charging the thing except at night.  When I'm out not around an access point I turn wifi off (not sure how much that helps).  GPS applications seem to drain the battery the fastest (google maps / earth in sat mode use an buttload of data, which usually is going over 3g - so put them in non-sat-view mode)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An ongoing review of the powerhouse", "unixReviewTime": 1285804800, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2010"}

I will say my OEM battery was near the end of its life.  Also the back is much like the black evos so it's got a rubbery texture with it.

HTC has pushed out quite a few updates that have improved battery life tremendously, so I now use the OEM battery for everyday use.*Update*I followed the manufacturer recommendations and charged this 6 times to get the maximum amount of battery life. After a few days of testing using Battery Monitor I found I could get 24+ hours with 4G/GPS/Highest brightness on and 38+ hours with 3G/GPS/Highest brightness on before reaching the 5% warning.Original Review:I had been waiting for this battery to be released by Seidio for such a long time. To be honest the battery life of the OEM battery was horrible and I could only get around 8 hours of solid use out of my phone before my \"5% until empty\" warning came up. Now that I have this battery, I don't even worry about running out of power! I can have 4G running at all times and still get double what the OEM battery got and with 4G off the phone will last for days! The battery itself adds minimal weight to the phone.5/5 for the batteryThe backing that the battery comes with has the same soft touch coating that the OEM backing has, and has \"SEIDIO\" imprinted on the back. It adds about 3MM of thickness and it actually doesn't make the phone seem much more bulkier. In fact, texting is easier now with the extended backing because I can wrap my index fingers around it and stabilize the phone much better. The flash LEDs are not covered at all, the camera lens sits perfectly center, and the holes for the sound are sufficient and don't degrade the quality of sound when I play music.5/5 for the backingTo the person that said when taking a picture with flash it causes a washed out lower right in the picture, I tested this out in numerous conditions and never saw any washing out so you may have had your backing not on tight enough. Make sure that all the latches are snapped in around the case before you take pics.All in all, the extra thickness is worth it! Don't waste your money on the 1750 mAh \"extended\" batteries, they suck!

I knew that all too well because my battery reached half of it's capacity close to noon at school on Mondays and Wednesdays. I hate the fact that I had to bring the charger with me. Then, I wanted to go for a better battery and I decided to get the Acase despite having conflicting reports, but half the price of this battery. As soon as I got it and after about a week of use with it, I saw very little improvement and I felt disappointing with it because not only did the case bumped up the battery area, but the entire back! That was really annoying and I gave the Acase to my dad who found use of it for his Incredible and went back to the original stock battery after ordering this one. I was rather excited to see what this baby can do after reading all of the positive reviews for the Seidio. When I got it, it was much better packaged and more presentable than the Acase. I started to see it was a little better than the Acase, but was still disappointed. Then it started getting better and it still is! I really haven't let it die below 15% battery life yet. I really need to do that sometime to get better results. But I've left it on the charge over night and it does a great job. Yesterday, I went out to wifi on my laptop and had my phone with me. I checked texts and emails regularly and it went from the 84% to 70% within 4 hours. It tends to last the longest after getting under 90%. That's a lot better than the Acase or the stock battery. This phone doesn't stay at in the 90's range so much so you can forget about that, but I don't know yet because I still have to let it die down and charge it the more proper way. I'm sure it will last a lot longer if I do that. I also try to keep the wifi, bluetooth, etc. off on my phone whenever possible. I'm pretty confident I can get through the day without charging this phone now.I also know about the issue about not being able to fit a regular case on to the phone due to the extended battery. I ordered a blue Seidio Active case to do this hack I saw online where you can cut out the back on it. ;) I'll post pictures on here if I can so I can show you how it turns out. I'll also keep you updated on how the battery is doing, but so far, it's worth it to me =)Update: I'm happy to announce that i managed to keep my battery in the 90s for nearly 4 hours! Not only that, I can actually last little over half a day without charging! I'm really confident to ditch the charger and leave it at home. I only keep the cord with me in case I want to share things between my phone and my laptop. One secret I discovered which us from one of the reviewers is that you should power your phone all the way down. Running applications and the operating system itself will prevent this battery from reaching its full capacity. Also, if you see it charged with the green dot at the top while its on, its not really charges. I think its due to the fact it only recognizes the original stock battery. As soon as you power it down, that green light will turn orange, showing you that the battery itself is not entirely charged. Just power it down overnight. That's time for sleep anyways. By the time you wake up, the diy should be green and you can turn it on to enjoy a long lasting battery. Try killing apps that you aren't using to save battery life. An advanced task killer will help, but you'll have to actually force stop apps that come back on after its been already killed.I also managed to get a case and make some modifications to it to give it some personality. Hopefully, I can post a picture on here to show you guys. Its best if you get a plastic or rubber case so its easier to cut through for the modification =) I hope this was helpful!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't get the Acase!

The second thing I noticed was that I drained the battery in a single afternoon.That brings us to the Seidio Innocell 3500 mAh battery.

I find that the precision cover with its slightly thicker form makes handling the phone a bit easier, does not interfere with the flashlight, and provides some badly-needed protection for the camera lens.Pros:1.

This is a veritable bargain at $99.99 or less, and I couldn't resist getting it to initiate GSM service with AT&T.; I liken going from a conventional flip phone to this touch screen to putting someone in a stick shift car that's driven an automatic for the last 40 years.  The  munchkin sized owner's manual is the worst I've ever had the misfortune to try to use. No meaningful index, very vague tutorial on features, pictured icons (in the manual) so small as to be illegible. Sadly, there isn't (yet?) an online manual which one may print out..Still....I think I'm going to really like this phone. (naww[...] update) FM radio with or without a wired headset, very good volume in ALL functions including speakerphone, a whole bevy of  intriguing  foo-foo  features.  Bluetooth wireless headset stereo capability on music IN the phone, FM radio wired headset only (or no headset)..I was able to assign this phone to the standard AT&T; minutes plan rather than their prepaid \"GO\" plan. Strangely, about half of the AT&T; and independent stores said it HAD to be a \"prepaid GO phone\", half had no problem using it with a conventional plan and SIM card. Happy days! A conventional plan, month-to-month WITHOUT a contract. I'm thrilled..I'll shoulder most of the blame for the problems I'm having with the touch screen.  I don't think it's the most user-friendly touch screen (particularly compared to my GPS units), but I'm learning..This LG Prime LGS390 phone has (at least initially) had the most favorable feedback from users of ANY cell phone. IMHO it benefits in quality from being made in Korea (LG is Korean) rather than China. Just an opinion..I find it interesting that LG initially stood for \"Lucky Goldstar\" for years. Now it's either \"Lets Go\" or \"Life's Good\".  Sounds more `Western', I guess..A good phone.  Go for it.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ADDENDA: A few disappointing qualities have arisen since my initial report. This phone WILL NOT work with a (blue tooth) \"X Link\". THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR ME!!  First phone EVER that wouldn't.  X Link even has a downloadable  \"LG patch\" to correct problems. This with the latest X Link software is of no use.  In addition, the voice recognition is very poor, and takes three operations to access that function. Also, there is apparently no way of enabling any audio notification of messages received and waiting. (At least as far as I'm able to discern with the nearly worthless owner's manual)  Some silliness from the owner's manual pages 98 & 99:\"Hold the phone as you would any phone with the antenna pointed up and over your shoulder.\" ...\"Do not touch the antenna unnecessarily when the phone is in use\". Gee! I was shorted the aforementioned \"antenna\".My wife absolutely hates this phone. All the `bling bling' features (FM Radio, etc.) don't get it with her. I am forced to get her a conventional flip phone. This is NOT a user friendly device for placing  phone calls QUICKLY without an error every fourth time or so.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ADDENDA II: 8-29-10  I had to throw in the towel on these phones. Squeeked by on the 28th day of my 30 day 'satisfaction guarantee' and sold 'em back to AT&T.; It is absolutely ESSENTIAL that my Intellitouch X Link be operational. My wife was about to throw hers over the fence into the neighbor's swimming pool. I am now using two bare-bones Nokia 2720. And I REALLY mean bare bones. The bluetooth connectivity is fantastic! They're either $7.99 -referb. or $9.99 brand new from AT&T.; Just like finding them! No micro-sd capabilities, very limited internal memory.

After suffering through Virgin Mobile's locked down phones for over 4 years, I am utterly amazed at how versatile the LG Prime is. And the $50 credit (which expires in 90 days) makes this phone only $30 dollars here on Amazon.First of all, you can use a standard Micro USB cable to connect to PC, and attach a standard 3.5mm headphones to listen to music. No adapters needed. You also get FM radio, Bluetooth, an MP3 player, MicroSD reader, etc, etc. I mean it's worth the $30 just for the MP3 player capabilities alone.Second, when you connect this device to your PC, you are able see and copy any data files to the internal memory or the MicroSD card. None of the Virgin Mobile phones I've used in the past gave me this option.You can add Java ME applications with zero hassle. This is a major plus. There are thousands of free Java ME applications on the internet, which you can download using your PC and send them to your phone. For example, to install Opera Mini, you go to their website on your PC, download the full .jar file, and copy it to your MicroSD card (or the phone's internal memory). Next, disconnect the phone from PC, go to main menu, select \"My Stuff\", and finally select \"Memory Card\". You .jar file will be shown. If you tap the file, it will automatically start the installation process (fast and simple). No application restrictions, and that's definitely awesome.Everything else works great too. Screen is responsive. This is a small phone however (smaller that the iPhone). I also have no issues with the screen lock during calls. All you have to do is press the unlock side button and the screen in immediately unlocked.Additionally, AT&T; new rates are 10 cents per minute with no daily access fee (down from the original 25 cents). That's half of what  Virgin Mobile is asking.Overall I love it.

The phone itself is a somewhat more advance smart phone (offering more applications, more connectivity) at a much lower price (I paid less than half of what this is now selling for from a marketplace seller.)  When I recommended this, I was comparing it to an LGLG 620G Prepaid Phone (Net10)net10.  The phone was \"OK,\" the service just awful.  Bothe the service on At&T; and the phone are better than what I was using, but neither is as good or cost effective as what I am now using.  We have moved our entire family over, my parents are now in the process of replaing theirs as well.  I still think this is a pretty good phone and the service and connectivity is good as well.  It is just that both will cost substantially more, for less (minutes, options) than what I am getting with my new phone and service.  What At&T; is charging is pretty much standard rates for a pre-paid phone (which was a surprise to mer than I hae found better and less expensive (on the order of 5-10 fold) with what I am using now.My old review appears below.________________________________________________________________________________Now that the description has been edited to provide a more accurate description of the current rate pl;an, and we have lived with this for a while, I can do a better review of the phone itself.We had a bit of a run-in recently with one of the major carriers, who charged us $200 for our \"free\" time (mobile to mobile, nights & weekend) when my daughter went 1 minute over the included \"prime\" minutes.  So, after more than 10 years of overpaying for shoddy service, I quit and decided to get some pay as you go phones while we decide which phones/ plans are right for us. My daughter is in college and uses her cell as her primary phone, hence needing it more than the rest of us.  For her I got a touch screen on virgin mobile (that cost $150).  I went with them for the lower cost comprehensive plans.  My son barely ever used his phone, so I got him one of these thinking the $50 credit would last him a year. *NOTE* The included $50 is only good for 2 months....so this turned out to be a bit more expensive than I had thought.  BUT, the phone itself is pretty great....I bought an LG 610 for myself (net10) thinking it would get me the service I needed at a very low cost.  the phone is decent, but does not have many features, *and* I will note that the plan is almost the same as at&t;'s.My son's phone (this model) is so so much better, and at a lower cost, that I bought another for my husband....and now, I have phone envy.If I could return my $40 phone, I would, and would trade it in for one of these.  Not only does it have a large bright touch screen, but it has features found on many of the higher end models: a camera, a calendar and date book, mp3 player, note taking feature.I have looked at just about every pre-paid phone on the market and this beats just about all of them at a fraction of the price.  In fact, now that I see that you can get a bigger card which holds the minutes longer (and at a lower cost/ month) I may side-line my phone and buy another one of these for myself!I will add, for those of you who have one, or are thinking of purchasing one, that it does not come with a case.

Now that I've been using the protector for several weeks, I have to wonder if the company that makes these screen protectors just paid for a bunch of false reviews! I don't like this screen protector for several reasons:1. The film is very, very difficult to put on. This was my third or fourth item to put a protective screen on. It was by far the hardest to get on without bubbles or dust. Bubbles seem to crop up from nowhere after the film has adhered. They won't be pushed out with the squeegee. You have to start over. Dust particles are literally attracted to the adhesive. In a room without A/C or a fan, on a large cleared surface that has been practically sterilized I don't know where dust could from but it'll find its way under the film. You'll use the little strips of dust remover but end up sticking a particle somewhere else. Then you'll have to start over. You'll probably have to trash the first protector and maybe even the second too.2. The Steinheil screen gets oils on it more than any other I've used, even the cheapest ones that came with cheap cases. You'll notice the screen looks horribly grimy and wipe it with your shirt. Voila - you've smeared grime everywhere. It's gross. I've made it a habit to wash my hands frequently (maybe compulsive but it's always worked for me), so there shouldn't be many oils on my hands. The cheap screen on my iPod touch gets sparkly after a good wipe, the Steinheil gets more smeary. Even after I used an expensive microfiber made for camera lenses, the screen still looks oily and gross. I wonder what kind of residue was transferred to the cleaning cloth. Ugh.3.

I loved the colors and liked the protection it gave over the standard cases. I dropped my phone on a brick walkway leaving work and though there was a chunk missing from the corner of the case the phone was unharmed! I was delighted with the case at that point. The downfall came about a month into using the case, I noticed the coating began to come off the sides of the hard backing. I think there is a quality issue here as I never experienced this with otterbox cases.  The other issue is that the soft shell gets loose especially above the charging port. I think that if I dropped the phone and it were to fall straight down the rubber would push to the side and the bottom glass would be exposed to chipping. I like the slim feel and the look of this case however I think I would like something a bit more protective so I have gone ahead and ordered the Otterbox Defender from Amazon.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice case with some quality issues", "unixReviewTime": 1282608000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2010"}

The advantage to this dual case from Incipio is that it comes in a variety of different color combinations and you're able to get two contrasting colors (white/gray looks really good on a white iPhone). The inner silicone case goes on very easily, but provides minimal support and feels exactly like a balloon that hasn't been inflated. The case covers some of the buttons on the side, but it is still easy enough to press them.The outer case provides some much needed protection and it slides right on over the silicone inner layer. The sliding on wasn't as easy as I was anticipating and once in place you can see a few spots where the outer layer does not provide any protection (top/bottom). Once both layers are in place the phone has a nice sturdy feel without having too much bulk added.Overall this is a decent case, but there were better options out there from Belkin and Case Mate that only had one hard outer layer that felt sturdier and was easier to put on and take off. You could use just the outer layer of this case without the inner silicone, but I wouldn't recommend solely using the inner layer.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent case, but the inner silicone layer is mediocre at best", "unixReviewTime": 1319328000, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2011"}

I bought it for a new iPhone 4S.  I must say, this is one of the best cases I've ever owned for a phone.  I've bought everything from the cheapest cases to the most expensive for past phones.  One of the most expensive cases I've ever owned was a Droid case that started out okay but literally fell apart at the seams after a few months.  This case is holding up very well.  It's a silicone case, so if you're particularly rough or harsh on your phone, expect fast wear and tear.  I use my iPhone regularly but I'm careful with it and never beat it up or throw it around as I've seen a lot of others do.  Not only do my phones look the same at the end of my contract as they did the day I bought them, but cases last pretty good as well.  So for that expensive case to fail, it really must have been rubbish.  This affordable case on the other hand, is not rubbish and fits the phone like a glove.  It offers a stylish non-slip gripping surface, and all buttoins, cameras, and openings have perfect cut-outs.  Nothing is obstructed, not even partially.  My 4S fits perfect.  The only intentionally covered buttons are the volume buttons and power button.  The thickness and flexibility of the case is just right, allowing me to easily push the buttons whenever needed, even without looking.  The bottom of the scase is cut so perfectly, it allows my iphone to fit on my speaker dock without removing the case.  Now that is a major plus.  I mainly carry the phone in my pocket and occassionally some lint will intrude, but it's nothing a can of spray air and a quick wipe with a cloth can't fix.  If anything gets really bad or a lot of debris finds its way into the case, the case is easily removable for cleaning or whatever the need may be.  I am very happy with this case and very satisfied with my purchase.  This has become my new iPhone case of choice.

(1) I have many chargers in many locations - car, bedroom, kitchen, work, mom's house, etc.  Some are fatter than the original apple plug and stretch out the opening on the candyshell case and eventually break the plastic at the opening by the connection port.  No plastic means no breakage.  Also since the hole for headphones is too small for anything other than apple brand headphones you may need to open the hole up a bit.  It's easier to trim the headphone hole for larger headphone plugs without completely damaging the case because there's no plastic.  I just take a knife and twirl it around in there to open it up then use a really sharp knife to clean up the edge a bit so there are no scraps hanging off.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've tested many and this is my favorite", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2011"}

I thought that nothing had changed, until last week when I removed my phone from a different case for some cleaning. Much to my astonishment, a clean crack was running from top to bottom on the rear glass of the phone! I remember dropping it once, but with a hard plastic shell I thought no damage had been done. Not so, apparently.I immediately jumped on Amazon to look for a better case, and found this rubberized shell from Incipio. I have used their products before - I had a white case for a previous phone that simply got too dirty too quickly, but had since forgotten about their products. I wanted something that would be thick enough to protect the phone from any subsequent damage (silicone bumpers were out), but that would also not add too much bulk (Otterbox were also out). I liked the thicker look of the polymer used in this case, and decided to go for it.In the box was the case (of course) as well as several accessories that I hadn't even noticed would be included. A microfiber cleaning cloth was in the box, as well as a protective film for the screen, as well as a plastic squeegee to remove air bubbles when applying. The screen protector is one of the nicer ones I have used - it does not affect quality or tactile response, and when applied to a clean screen will leave no bubbles whatsoever!The case itself is a little thinner than I expected, but seems to offer superior protection. It is tougher than silicone but lacks the frictionless characteristics of rubber (try pulling a rubber phone case out of your skinny jeans....). That said, the polymer used is easy to grip, making it an ideal choice for people who tend to drop their phone, and yes, it is easily removed from said jeans! I was particularly pleased with the front of the case which has raised ridges above the screen. Measuring at around 0.1\", they provide ample protection for the front of your phone without being too imposing. The raised covers on the buttons are easy to push, unlike other cases I have used.Overall I am very pleased with this case! It offers a nice all-around protection without bulking up your phone, and although it commands a slight price premium compared to other slim cases, it is still miles cheaper than other Otterbox-type cases. I am very pleased, and highly recommend giving the Incipio NGP case a try!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent!", "unixReviewTime": 1367193600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2013"}

{"reviewerID": "A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z", "asin": "B003T5JJVY", "reviewerName": "Jim", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "I bought one of these for use with my iPad. The cable that comes with the iPad is short (just a little over 42\" long according to my tape measure), and so thin it looks fragile. I tried using it with the adapter plugged into an extension cord so I could comfortably use my iPad in bed while it's plugged in, but this was more hassle than it was worth. Plus, I wanted to have an extra cord so I could leave one (the 42\" one) attached to a desktop for use whenever I need to sync my iPad.Griffin's 3 meter (approximately 9 feet) long cable looks and feels rugged, it does not kink up on me (unlike a long, cheap USB extension cable I own), and its length makes it easy to use my iPad on AC because with 9 feet it's usually easy to reach an outlet (and one can still use an extension cord if 9 feet isn't long enough). That's it. I didn't buy it for syncing, just so I could use AC without having to use the short cable that comes with the iPad. The cable is warrantied for a year and it certainly looks like it will last a long time if not mishandled. There is an amusing, entertaining albeit not very informative 3-minute long video about this cable at the website for Griffin Technology. The video doesn't convey any information about the cable you don't already know by virtue of the fact that it's called the 3 Meter USB to Dock Cable, but the video says something about Griffin's sensibility that I like.The part of the cable that plugs into the iPad is thick - 3/8\" versus less than 2/8\" for the cable the comes with the iPad by my measurements. I can get it to fit through the opening around the power/sync port on a Simplism brand iPad skin that I own by stretching the silicone a bit, but after doing that once I got the sense that doing that regularly would leave the silicone stretched out, so now I remove the skin when I use the cable.

It looks very cool, modern and sleek.The surface, which is a black sticker, grips the iPhone nicely so it does not budge - I also have a vinyl padded skin on mine so it grips even better.  The clip on the side holds the cord in place and the jack is wedged between the iPhone and top so that during use there is NO way for the jack to come loose.  Very nice feature.The clarity of the handset is top-notch....at first.  No one knew I was on a handset except for those who could guess because they couldn't hear background noise.  It was fabulous.  The handset was comfortable on my ear and was easy to hold against my shoulder and ear to go hands-free.  The cord could have been longer though.The one improvement I would have liked to see, aside from a longer cord, is a heavier base - one accidental pull or stretch of the cord and the whole stand comes with it.The reason I am torn about this item is because nine days into using it, the handset no longer worked properly.  That is, I could faintly hear the caller and they almost could NOT hear me.  I played around with wiggling the jack but to no avail.  I am thinking that maybe I got a defective unit but I am not sure if I want to go through it again in case it happens again.I suggest that if you are game to take a chance, go for it and see how long it lasts for you...like i said, it may have been the random single defective unit - when you mass produce something, this is bound to happen eventually.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Cool idea but am torn over this.....", "unixReviewTime": 1289779200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2010"}

This super-slim stylish case eliminates the antennae issues, while protecting your iPhone 4 with unhindered access to the display, controls, and ports.  This case is made of a decorative hard polycarbonate back seamlessly attached to 1.6mm soft rubber sides.Griffin's Reveal Etch has a couple drawbacks from using the soft rubber material on the sides.  The rubber covers some of the buttons offering protection from the elements; however it cushions bumps and falls and not fully protect from potential damage.  Additionally, the thin rubber is too thick for use with my docking station radio.  What protective qualities this case has is useless when removal is required for iPhone use.However the Reveal Etch effectively and stylishly eliminates the iPhone 4's antennae reception issue.  The soft rubber sides are comfortable to hold and offer resistance to sliding.  The hard polycarbonate back is decorative and finger print resistant.  The iPhone4 fits snuggly in the case and looks great.I'm not sure how much better a hard shell case would protect the iPhone from falls, but it seems reasonable that it could.  My partner has a clear hard-case which works well with the docking station, but he's mentioned liking the look of the Reveal Etch more.  I agree, I don't like the look of his clear hard-case at all.

Here is why we like the case:1. This is the slimmest case you can buy, and is very easy to put on and remove. The case covers the Iphone 4S with a thin rubber bumper around all the edges and has a clear plastic protector on the back of the phone to \"reveal\" it. The case adds very little thickness or weight.2. Although the two volume buttons on the left side and the on/off button on the top are covered, there is no noticeable difference when using them (unlike the Otterbox cases, where there is a very noticeable difference, though in turn there is more protection).3. The case provides good scratch protection for the back and sides. NOTE: I purchased a screen protector for the front since the case does not provide any protection in the front.4. The case slips easily in and out of a pocket or purse.5. The case is attractive and also lets you see most of the phone.6. The case permits using the phone in a charging dock (at home I use the XtremeMac InCharge Duo) or music dock (I use the Altec Lansing at work). This is critical for me because I like to be able to use a dock to charge my phone or listen to music through a sound system without having to remove the case (as is true of the Otterbox cases).IMPORTANT: This is NOT a rugged case designed to absorb lots of shocks and spills in harsh environments. If that is a concern, consider something else. But if the main goal is to avoid scratches and damage from an occasional shock or spill, then this case will do the trick.Update Feb. 7, 2012: I removed the case; typed my name, address, phone number, and email address on a piece of paper; rested that paper on the back of the iPhone; then put the case back on. The clear back of the case holds the paper in place without any glue or tape.

With this in mind the adapter (any adapter) cannot make up for the small gap that will exist between the SIM and the adapter itself. I don't care what you use or do, this is not something that can be helped.So here is the safe way to remove the device from most phones. Obviously I only have a limited number of phones I can test this on and you should take some time to study your particular device to see if this will work. I take no responsibility for any problems.Cut a small piece of plastic longer than a SIM but close to the same width. I used a piece of screen protector film with the peel away backing still in place. Such a film is flexible and thin enough to slide between the SIM and the contact pins. You need something this thin because you are going to use it to help assist your SIM with adapter into place and out of your phone if you are removing it.The idea is simple: use this film to push down the pins and to provide a safe insertion and removal. For my wife's blackberry and Galaxy Note I placed the thin piece of film into the SIM slot. Then I inserted the SIM and removed the film. This ensures that the SIM is seated properly in the phone. If you want to remove the SIM you simply insert the film BENEATH the SIM card, push all the way to make sure it is under the SIM completely and between the SIM and the contact pins. Gently remove your SIM while keeping the film in place. Do this right and your card won't rip the contact pins from your phone.Not brain surgery. Just a few moments of thought.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "They work..With a 2nd grade IQ you can remove them too!

I had to upgrade from my Motorola Backflip which if you think the Captivate is memory bound just look at the Backflip. Having seen a Captivate from a person in the seat next to me on the airplane I knew it was the phone I wanted to move to.It wasn't until I got the phone that the one feature I depend on as a road warrior, GPS, doesn't work well on the Captivate. Getting a GPS lock takes time. Tracking while moving in a vehicle and it can't keep up. I tried all the \"settings\" people posted which basically only helped the initial lock time from minutes to less than a minute. Tracking is useless. Since I truly love the other features of the phone I sprung for a GPS dongle which hopefully will resolve my GPS issue. But a phone as expensive as the Captivate it should have GPS working out of the box. Even the Motorola Backflip GPS works better than the Captivate which is sad. On the Captivate I tried Google Maps Navigation, Waze and CoPilot Live which all worked just fine on the Backflip on the same streets I've tried the Captivate out on.Otherwise all the great things people have posted about the screen are true. Memory wise it is way better than the Backflip and the processor is loads faster. Photos are amazing even without a flash. Haven't done a video yet.But I can't recommend this phone due to the poor quality GPS. Even rooting and installing Android v2.2 (Cognition ROM v2.3b8) made no difference to navigation.  The lock is slightly faster but it just does not keep up on the road.  You need a GPS dongle (see below) to get navigation to work.  I used the Google Navigator application but Waze and CoPilot Live both exhibit the same behavior with the built in GPS.[Update: Jan 7, 2011] Received the GlobalSat BT-395 from Amazon and it works with the Captivate! Download the free \"Bluetooth GPS\" application from Android market and use that to connect to the 395. This has made the Captivate function as a navigation device... finally. Though I do have the downside of having to carry yet another device in my jacket pocket and remember to charge it up every so often.I also happened across an issue of Consumer Reports yesterday that ranked the Captivate right behind the iPhone 4. This is another reason I've stopped relying on Consumer Reports. They rated the navigation on the Captivate as \"Very good\" when it is not.[Update Jan 19, 2011] Knocked it down to one star because GPS does not work for navigation on Android v2.2 using the Cognition ROM. I do not recommend people go down this path unless they are highly technically skilled. But it doesn't fix anything. The lock time is faster than stock but navigation is still too far behind to be of any use. This looks like a hardware problem.

{"reviewerID": "A1T77PV08QMYJN", "asin": "B003TLMQG8", "reviewerName": "BillyTheKid", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "I was very enthusiastic about this Galaxy S phone, brilliant 4\" touchscreen, Android OS and a host of other smartphone features, what else could I ask for? So I purchased one through Amazon Wireless in September for $99 with a two year upgrade on my family plan.Unfortunately I was not prepared for the reality. Some features simply did not work right and others didn't work at all. Even more frustrating has been the epic wait for an upgrade to Android OS 2.2 (Froyo) One drawback that I knew of and decided to swallow was allowing AT&T; to decide which apps would be available for your Android. After all the hype about openness and freedom to use the device the way you want, AT&T;'s Android phones all disappoint. Many of the best apps are not available (Firefox, Skype, and a bunch of other ones that are available on Verizon's Droids.) This has been increasing frustrating the longer I have had the phone.Let's continue in chronological order with the problems I found after purchasing the Captivate:First, I found out that email forwarding and sometimes replying would truncate the original text in the message after about one line of text. It was very embarrassing trying to forward a message to someone only to have them respond, \"What are you talking about?\"Second, I found out that Wifi, by default would turn off as soon as the screen turns off, meaning that if you were listening to Pandora on Wifi and you had a limited data plan, you could quickly find yourself over the data limit, even though you thought you were using Wifi. (cough*AT&T; conspiracy*cough) There is a hidden menu within the Wifi settings menu that allows you to set the Wifi sleep policy to never. More recently I have been having problems with Wifi where it appears that I am connected, but there is no internet connectivity, even with my home network. This has been a big issue for me as I have a 200MB monthly limit on data, and that would not be a problem if Wifi worked.Third, I found out on my Thanksgiving trip that the GPS DOES NOT WORK. I had read some complaints about the GPS on forums before, but didn't realize it was a problem affecting ALL Captivate phones (perhaps all Galaxy S phones)Maybe I was spoiled by my previous phone (Blackberry Curve 8310) which now seems much more plain than anything else out there, however, everything on that phone WORKED! emailing was flawless, GPS and Wifi always performed as expected (it didn't have Wifi ;)Samsung finally released a GPS \"fix\" called \"GPS Restore\" in early December that was supposed to calibrate the GPS and eliminate the problem for good. It turned out to be just smoke and mirrors. I don't use the GPS all the time but when I do, I need it to work. While trying to find a gas station off the highway earlier this week, I almost ran out of gas driving around, not knowing where I was. The GPS placed my two exits back with an accuracy radius of at least 2 miles. A few times the radius shrank down to a few hundred feet but still placed my in the wrong location. It just doesn't work and it is unacceptable.Finally, and this has been a problem from the start, we were promised Froyo within a couple of weeks, back in September. It is January and we are still stuck with android 2.1 while the Nexus S, which is practically the same phone, is running android 2.3 (Gingerbread) I blame mostly Samsung for this as other Galaxy S phones are also stranded waiting for the update. Interestingly, the rest of the world with a Galaxy S phone has already been updated to Android 2.2 so perhaps AT&T; should take part of the blame here. You may not think 2.2 vs 2.1 is a big deal, but believe me, it is. Froyo would allow you to forward emails and it even allows you to edit the text you are forwarding/ including in a reply. Supposedly it would fix the GPS issue, although I am skeptical of this and it would allow your phone to run much faster by fully utilizing its resources.Bottom line, If you are at all enthusiastic about this phone for any reason, you will be disappointed.Otherwise you may find it works for you and it is just fine. After all, it is has the best screen on the market, 4\" Super AMOLED with the best colors I have ever seen on a phone. Only the iPhone can compete with the screen but on different parameters - its resolution is betterThe 1Ghz processor is fast, although it would be much faster on Froyo or Gingerbread if there is ever an update.The camera takes great pictures where there is enough light (no flash) and the video recorder is also surprisingly sharp for a phone.SWYPE is awesome, the best text entry experience on a phone.The Vibrate is very weak and I often do not feel it.Adobe Flash also doesn't work, maybe its not the latest version, maybe it just doesn't have flash, I don't know but it doesn't work.Finally, support has been a joke.

After describing all of these problems to Samsung they said they will be happy to fix everything if I only send my phone in for 6 days and let them reset it to factory settings (Thanks, but no thanks.)I will think very carefully if I ever want to get another AT&T; phone or another Samsung phone.

The fact that I got it for a penny (yes, one penny) through Amazon Wireless is just icing on the cake!  I haven't had this phone for very long, so my review is based on what I've experienced so far.Pros:The big, beautiful screen is wonderful. The colors are so vibrant.I love being able to enter so much information for my contacts.The keyboard is great, if not a bit sensitive.  However, a stylus helps with that. I'm still trying master the Swype keyboard. It isn't as easy as the videos make it look (big surprise).Being able to store so much information on the phone is great. I've downloaded lots of music, plus folders, and still have a ton of memory left.Love the variety of Android apps. I download them when I have access to WiFi, so that I don't use up my limited data plan.Unlike some reviewers have indicated, the GPS worked fine when I tried it.I actually don't make very many phone calls, but when I have done so, the caller's voice was very clear.This phone pairs up with other Bluetooth devices very easily.The pictures and videos I've taken, look great.Cons:I'm not happy that many web sites haven't caught up to the Android, yet. I tried to access numerous free TV sites only to be told that none of them support Android at this time. I hope this is something that will be rectified soon.After having dealt with Sony-Ericsson support people, I've been very disappointed with Samsung support. Their web site isn't very user-friendly, and they keep apologizing about their lack of information as to when this or that will be available. Also, after a very long chat with a Samsung person, to no avail, I finally got the help I needed from an AT&T; tech.UPDATE!!I've had this phone for seven months now, and I'm not as crazy about it as I was in the beginning.I will not be buying another Samsung phone because Samsung support sucks. When they came out with an update that included a Flash Player, I had trouble downloading it, contacted Samsung, and they never answered back. I've been too frustrated to do anything about it, but plan to call AT&T; support to see if I can get any help from them.Ending a phone call on this thing takes forever. Sometimes I have to press \"End Call\" for a long time before it will end, and I have to watch very carefully to make sure it doesn't stay connected.Making a phone call isn't that easy, either. It's hard to explain exactly what this phone does, but it sometimes seems to have a mind of its own when it comes to making phone calls.  I'm just glad I don't make that many of them, or I would probably have thrown it against a wall by now!The phone has become very difficult to turn off.  I have to hold the side button for a long time, and then I have to press on the \"Power Off\" button for what seems like forever. It shouldn't be that hard to turn the blasted phone off!I still like it for surfing the web, and it picks up on WiFi pretty easily so that I don't have to pay AT&T; for data usage. However, when my contract is up, I will be choosing another phone, probably from Sony Ericsson or Motorola.UPDATE III finally took my phone to an AT&T; repair store, and they agreed that it was \"buggy,\" so they replaced it. The replacement phone, with its upgrade to 2.2, works much, much better, so I'm a bit happier.  That being said, I still want a different phone when my upgrade time comes.  I've been looking at the HTC, and have added it to my list of phones to consider.BTW, when I was at the repair store, I overheard one of the reps tell someone that the Pantech phones were the most trouble-free phones.

According to the reviews, this phone fit the bill perfectly. But after 6 months, I can honestly say it was not a good purchase, even tho the phone does have a lot going for it.Pluses:Excellent camera--takes clear pictures, and the panorama feature is pretty cool.Screen is bright, clear, and honestly is one of the best displays on the market at the time. HD video on YouTube is crystal clear.You can increase the internal storage by the addition of a mini hd card--much cheaper than buying a larger capacity iPhone.Battery life was not bad.Minuses:Crapware that ATT installs is hugely annoying.Compared to the iPhone, the  interface is clunky. Probably not an issue for most, but since I use my phone a lot it became a big annoyance.Exchange mail was impossible. Gmail will not support Exchange unless you go with the enterprise version of Gmail, something my business was unwilling to do. I tried a few 3rd party exchange clients, they were all buggy. Also could not get Exchange to route to Gmail. This was a huge fail for me, as I need access to my corp mail. Probably my fault for not researching better, but yeah, Exchange mail on this phone was a no go.I did not experience the random shutting off issue, but the phone would occasionally get the hiccups when I tried to do more than one thing at a time.The four command buttons at the bottom of the screen had to be hit precisely or they would not function. Huge fail. Apple's one button system is far better. Perhaps my sausage fingers are to blame.Web browsing: Extremely painful--no mater what browser I used. Pages would not display correctly, page loads were slow, sometimes not loading at all. Probably not the phones fault but the browsers'.Call quality: switching from a Motorola Razr, I noticed an immediate downgrade in call quality. People complained that they could not hear me, that I sounded tinny. Had the same issues when listening to others. I also had tons of dropped calls, which I assumed was the fault of ATTs network. I also had issues getting on the network in remote locations, which I assumed was the network. But my friends had no issue connecting to the same network with their ATT phones. Many missed texts and \"where are u?\"Since switching to an iPhone 4 on ATT, I have not had as many dropped calls or network issues. I still do have problems with ATT, but not as many.GPS: Broken. No fix in sight.Updates: Doubt Froyo 2.2 will ever be released for this phone.In the end, I sold the Captivate and bought an iPhone 4, and since then I have had none of the issues that I had with the Captivate.

But I was due a new phone and after doing a ton of research, I decided to try the world of Android and get the Samsung Captivate. I was really impressed by the iPhone 4, but I liked the bright and brilliant screen of the Captivate and I thought it would be fun learning something new, which also got great reviews. I new that by choosing the Captivate I would be getting slightly inferior screen resolution, no front camera or flash, and a camera that is not nearly as good as that found on the iPhone 4. But the screen won me over.Last night I picked up my brand new Captivate and was really excited about trying it out. I did express my concerns about the many reports I had read about its poor quality GPS and I was told that I could return the phone if the GPS was not working properly. A store employee told me that I needed to download the newest version of Google Maps to insure that the GPS would work to its best capacity. He did the download, but it was my \"impression\" at the store, that the download may not have worked correctly. My intuition turned out to be correct.So I took the Captivate home and tried out the new GPS. Alas, it did not work at all. I made some adjustments recommended at several Captivate forums and still no luck. I moved to other locations and still no reading. I then started downloading several very well known apps like Amazon Kindle and the NY Times and I noticed that after waiting one hour for the apps to show up on my phone, that none of the downloads were working correctly. When I clicked on \"market\", I was informed that the downloads were just starting.I decided to return the phone to the store. Even though the store is located in a very heavily trafficked area, even there the GPS could not ascertain a location. Also the store employees agreed that the downloads were not functioning properly. In my view, they acted like they had seen these problems with the Captivate before, but I can't say for sure.Anyway, I exchanged it for an iPhone 4 which works perfectly right out of the box.

Skype, however, does not work on Captivate, at least not with current software.

The screen is gorgeous and bright, and the processor and GPU are amazing.  The camera takes good photos in decent light, and it also takes good high-resolution videos.  It feels very nice in the hand and is very light without feeling cheaply made.  The screen is also made of Gorilla Glass so it's nice and scratch resistant.However, there are a few things to keep in mind.  There is no flash for the camera, so pictures in low light situations won't turn out very good at all.  There's a night mode in the camera app, but it doesn't do all that much to help.  There's also no trackball/notification light so you won't know if you have messages or e-mails without actually waking the device.  The phone is a very symmetrical design so it can be hard to know which end is the top when pulling it out of your pocket, so you'll constantly find yourself holding it upside down when you go to look at it.  There's also the issue of AT&T; disabling HSUPA on this phone.  The hardware is perfectly capable of doing HSUPA, but AT&T; has turned it off so that those frequencies are less crowded for those using the iDevice.  We wouldn't want THEM to have slow upload speeds, now would we?But the real drawback is the crapware Samsung loaded on here.  TouchWiz, while it looks pretty nice, performs pretty terribly.  The development community has released lagfixes that speed up the phone considerably (I recommend Super Rooter Extreme for an all in one solution), but hopefully when Samsung releases Froyo it will have fixed all the lag issues.  Basically, for some reason when you launch an app it can stutter and the phone freezes for a second or two before it does anything.  Also, when rebooting the phone it takes forever to scan the onboard media storage to look for changes.  If you're willing to root there are temporary fixes in place that work well enough, but Samsung needs to take the reigns and get this squared away on their end, since other phones running stock Android don't have this problem.In the end, I still highly recommend it.  It's a bit more future-proof than the Nexus One (the only other high-end Android phone I would recommend on AT&T;) as far as hardware is concerned because the Hummingbird chipset is currently unrivaled for sheer power, and since there are Galaxy S phones running this chipset on multiple carriers the development community will come up with some great stuff for these phones over time.

{"reviewerID": "A1MRPX3RM48T2I", "asin": "B003TLMQG8", "reviewerName": "Winter", "helpful": [28, 33], "reviewText": "I've had the Captivate (or \"Galaxy S\") for a month now, and the whole time I've been bursting at the seams to review it...but first I had to take a little bit of time to separate what's great about the Captivate that's specific to the phone, versus what's great about a Droid-based smart phone in particular.First off, the Android OS is really very enjoyable.  The top-level screen can have 5 pages of whatever you like and the Applications page neatly organizes installed apps separately, to page through them as well.  If you're not familiar with this concept, think of the top-level screen as being similar to the Windows or Mac Desktop and the Applications area as being similar to the Start Menu/Launch Bar of your favorite computer OS.The best thing about the Captivate is the hardware:  the screen really takes up almost all of the phone's face, and it's vivid, colorful, and bright.  The battery cover is a slick one-two slide that makes it easy to access without being the first thing to fall off if you drop the phone.  The 1GHz processor inside the phone makes apps speedy, and I even find it to be fairly nimble about data use, easily grabbing onto my favorite Wi-Fi networks when I'm in range, then switching seamlessly over to AT&T;'s data network when I'm not.Then we have the good things about the Captivate:  calls are clear, I've had strong and clean reception even when I notice a drop in bars, and on those rare occasions I step into a dead zone, it seems to try its very best to hang on to the call...I can't explain it in technical detail, it's just the gut impression I get when I've driven or walked through areas that typically give me trouble on any phone and against all odds I stay connected (my office, for instance, is up against a cliff wall that closes further in near the top of the building).  One complaint about this phone (and many smart phones) has been battery drain, but I find it manageable:  if I choose to use the Power Toolbar (built-in and easy to add) and Advanced Task Killer app (a separate download, and a must for any smart phone owner), I can go 2 or 3 days on a single charge.  Usually it's easier to top it off at the end of the day or leave it plugged in when I'm not going to be using it for a while.  While the Captivate seems very wide, it is also very slim and thus surprisingly light.  I added the carbon-fiber hard case to the outside and it still weighs noticeably less than an iPhone 4.Using the Captivate is fairly simple:  the connector port for the charger or a data cable are one and the same:  a \"micro\" USB connector with a tiny sliding door to keep dirt out.  I much prefer this to the plastic peel-away tab that usually comes off in your hand if you're not careful.  The charger that comes with the phone also pops apart into a data cable, allowing you to detach the AC outlet prongs and connect to the computer.  And last, the navigation buttons are just four touch-sensitive spots along the base of the screen, with a slide rocker on the left side of the phone (for volume) and an unlock button on the right.  I've heard people say it's hard to pinch a button on one side without accidentally hitting the other (such as turning down the volume when you go to unlock the phone), but I haven't had this problem.More on the OS:  using Android 2.1 (soon to be FROYO), I find myself discovering neat little features that I enjoy.  For example, some of the wallpapers are interactive with the touch screen.  When I'm playing music, if I need to pause, I don't have to unlock the phone:  a tiny CD logo appears in the top with controls for pause/next/back.  The \"Swype\" feature of the OS is extremely responsive.  I didn't have to adjust any of this - the sensitivity really seems balanced between \"must mash to get a response\" and \"breathed on it and accidentally deleted something\".  Unlocking the phone requires a tap of the button and a swipe along the touch screen.  Even the tilt--a feature that began to annoy me in my Nokia phone--seems to both be quick to respond and easy to correct if you didn't mean to rotate the screen.Much as I enjoy this phone, all is not perfect.  The buttons sometimes don't respond properly.  There are times I have to tap twice, and there are times I try to hit 'back' and accidentally hit 'search' instead.  I'm not sure how much of that is in the programming, the hardware, or my thick thumbs.  The Search window is extremely handy, but it doesn't always frame the search properly.  For example, I might be in an app that has a long list of items on the screen, and search will zoom down the list straight to the item I'm looking for...and then in another app the search might launch a web browser and search the Internet for what I typed in.  I haven't really learned a good way to scroll down a long screen:  often I have to just flick downwards again and again until I get where I'm going.  And probably the most annoying feature is the actual call interface.  I haven't taken that final step to voice-activate my favorite call list, so when I manually drill into my contacts or favorites to find someone to call, it seems to require more steps than it should to place a call:  find the contact, tap their picture, tap the \"phone\" icon, if they have two numbers associated with them you have to specify which, and then you get to tap \"call\".The biggest drawback--and controversy--surrounding this phone though has to do with apps.  I've been very happy with my selection from the Android Market thus far, but I understand AT&T; prevents you from \"side loading\" other programs.  Apparently if you want something the market doesn't have to offer, you need to download an SDK (a developer's kit for programming mobile apps), \"root\" your phone, and follow some very specific steps to get it to work...some of which may brick the phone.  That's not bothered me here or there, but what has bothered me is my complete inability to remove all the AT&T; garbage that's been loaded on the phone.  For example, I like the Android Music Player app, but I really don't want the AT&T; Music app that promises to guzzle data and stream all my music (and requires me to pay a monthly fee).  There are Navigation apps that function this same way:  now that I have Google Navigation, I'd rather yank the AT&T; stuff off...but I can't.  I can either ignore it...or go the \"root and try not to brick\" route.  I've been an AT&T; customer for almost 10 years now, and what I always liked most about them was my freedom of choice.There have been some complaints about the fact that the Captivate's camera lacks a flash.  It is a shame that this feature is missing, but apart from that I have to say that the pictures I have taken with the phone have been excellent, better than the first digital camera I purchased years ago and definitely better than the last phone I had, which did have a flash.  The interface for the phone is dirt-simple, and can even lock in standby mode, in case you want to tuck it away for a bit, but be ready to shoot with a tap of the unlock button.  The Gallery app in the Android OS does a snappy job of both organizing my groups of pictures and in making it easy to flip through:  clean thumbnails tell me at a glance which collection of pictures I'm looking at so I can select the group I want to view.If you're in the market for a smart phone and you'd like to try the Droid OS, I can't say enough about the Captivate.  It's got a brilliant screen, speedy hardware, and runs the OS quite smoothly.  If you're an AT&T; customer, you should be prepared to ignore (or deal with) the pre-loaded apps.  Either way, this is quite an excellent smart phone, whose benefits far outweigh its drawbacks.USEFUL TIP:  when connecting to a computer, it's not immediately obvious how to make it work, and a lot of people are having problems.  When you connect the cable, the \"Smart Phone (Kies)\" option doesn't appear to work.  Instead, you have to choose \"USB (mass storage)\"...which then still doesn't make the phone's files and folders show up in Windows--in Windows 7 it will just tell you a Samsung Captivate has been connected to the computer, but you can't \"see\" it.  You have to take one extra step:  from the main screen, access the pull-down menu.  You will see \"USB Connected\" in the list of notifications.  Tap that, and you'll get a prompt to \"Mount\" the phone.  The moment you do this, everything works:  the phone maps two drives (one for the phone's memory, one for your memory card) and you can access files and folders just as you do on a USB \"thumb\" drive.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Definitely Magical", "unixReviewTime": 1283990400, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2010"}

However, my son recently got an IPhone and I gave this cover to him and decided to order another one for myself.  What I received this time was not the same cover that I received the first time! The 2nd cover I received is much like the one pictured above from Holliwood779 [...] except mine doesn't have the hole in the back for the apple logo.  I am not very happy with this 2nd cover because I don't feel that it covers enough of the phone to really protect it.  I expected it to wrap around all 4 edges not just be open on the top and the bottom.  I am pleased with the color...this one and the first one are both a nice deep red with a bit of a metallic sheen.  However, when you reorder an item because you liked it the first time, you expect to get the EXACT same thing the 2nd time so I am disappointed with the 2nd cover.  If the seller is going to send you something not exactly as pictured and instead has a variety of items which you may receive, it should be clearly noted in the product description that \"actual products may vary\".  The only other redeeming thing about this cover is that it is cheap and there was free shipping, so I won't ask for a refund or return it, but if you order this cover don't expect to get exactly what is pictured here.

Thinking I could live with that, I completed the application and instantly noticed the shiny, mirror-like gleam. How impressive! Surely, when I turn the iPhone on, the glassiness will go away, right? Wrong. Very disappointing to note that, when simply trying to use the phone INdoors, it's nearly impossible to read the screen. The gorgeous \"retina display\" I paid for with the iPhone 4 was compromised by a nearly oil-like combination of smudged rainbow colors.So, the product does exactly what it advertises: gives your phone a glassy, mirrored shine.

Ironic choice of words huh?  Yes, it made the EVO's beautiful screen look less clear, as if turning an HD TV back to non-HD, not to mention the rainbow colors it showed on the center of the screen.  I quickly removed it and tried the other two brands.  You get what you paid for.Between the Seidio and Steinheil screen protectors, I'd say they are about on par, except the Steinheil Ultra Crystal had a brighter effect (it allowed more light from the EVO from reaching your eye balls), and the feel against it had less friction than the Seidio.  If I had to choose, I'd definitely go with the Steinheil.  Just don't make the mistake of what I did by first putting on the screen sticky by accident, and then realizing I needed to use the thicker screen protector.**** TIP 1: Do not use the stupid squeegie/plastic thing that comes with the product to smooth/remove air bubbles.  It will leave scratches on your screen protector.  Instead, use your thumbs by pressing down on the film against your EVO screen to smooth out the air bubbles as you lay down the protector cover.**** TIP 2: If you notice that there are particles underneath the protector cover after applying it already, get good ol' trusty Scotch tape.  It's good enough that it'll stick to the cover so you can peel the cover from the EVO screen easily (as the tape will stick to the cover) and will be able to pick up particles, and weak enough that it doesn't leave any messy residue.  For best results, have a 2nd person help you.If the protector cover is already laid down on the EVO screen and you want to grab a particle that's stuck underneath, you (the person holding the phone and applying the cover) take a piece of scotch tape and stick it on the protector cover so you can peel the cover up slightly.  Your partner in crime will then take another piece of scotch tape and stick it against the under side of the protector cover (right on the cover itself since the particle would have got stuck on the sticky side of it) to pick up the particle.  Once this is done, you can slowly release the protector cover back down and you should notice the particle is now gone.  I did this like a dozen times to remove small particles and it worked like a charm.  It's also best if you do not position your head directly on top of your phone when performing this, as to not cause additional particles from falling down.  If you don't have a partner in crime, you should be able to do this yourself if you're careful.

The plastic is not any slipperier than the metal band around the edge of the phone, but not tacky so it is easy to slide in or out of the pocket of you skinny jeans (FYI - this is an assumption - I don't actually wear skinny jeans but have had no issues with regular jeans). The only drawback is the screen is completely exposed except for the tiny plastic rim the holds the phone in the case.

Isn't too tight or loose by any means. The texture is fabulous and the fact that the case has a black ring around the camera, DOES indeed help with the flash. I have taken multiple pictures in different settings using flash and there is no hue whatsoever. The sleep/wake & volume buttons are a little hard to press but I like that; considering I've had other cases where it was extremely easy to press those buttons and my iPhone lock screen was always on when I looked in my purse because the sleep/wake button kept getting pressed.

But I had by then found a great Incipio case that I just find perfect so I really didn't use the CandyShell. Over xmas I upgraded my wife to an iPhone 4 and so I put the newly received CandyShell on her phone. All the reflective flash problems have been fixed and the case fits perfectly. She really likes it and it's a solid case.I have a lingering issue that the side and top of the new case might \"split\" with frequent removal - my old candyshell case had begun to come apart at the top and sides due to the frequent removal needed for some docks. I am not sure if this has been fixed with the new case. I would advise if you use it, remove the case from the bottom and not the top - also try to not remove it unless you have to.---------I did not buy this case from Amazon, got it from ATT, but thought I'd post my experience. If it weren't for one very serious flaw, this would be hands down the single best iphone case ever. With my iPhone 3 and 3gs and now the iPhone 4, I am sorta on a quest to find the best case I can. I went thru about 6 or more iphone 3gs cases before settling on one.Pros:1. Nice, grippy rubber case, won't slip out of your hand. Not too hard but not too soft.2. It's rubber as opposed to silicone. So it should not stretch out of shape. Every silicone case stretches, every one of them.3. Very very snug fit, slim profile also. Seems to fit in most of my docks.4. Button alignment is perfect. After a day you will forgot the iphone is even in a case at all!5. Re-enforced corners!6. Basically it fits the iphone like a glove. No wriggle room at all.Cons:1. The rear of the case has an opening for the iphone 4's camera and new LED flash. But with the case on, the LED flash reflects off side of the case's opening and onto the lens when you try to take a flash picture. The result is a useless picture that looks like someone is pointing a flashlight into the lens. So, if you want to take pics with the LED flash, you need to wrestle the case on and off which might end up stretching it over time. I think if the hole around the LED were larger it would not reflect off as it does. I tested this by taking numerous pics of the same angle & subject with and without the case. The difference is night & day. With the case on, the pics are terrible. Without the case, they are very good and the lighting is even. Again, this is just with the LED flash.2. Dock connector opening works fine with the regular apple dock cable but it's too tight to plug in the apple AV cable. Again, you have to take the case off which is not good. So, if you use the AV cable a lot, you might think carefully here.3. Updated on 07-15-2010 - As a result of constant taking the case off and putting it on to use the flash, I have noticed the black rubber / plastic has cracked near the top of the case and around the \"silence\" button. The case fits so tight you have to really peel it off. This is a good thing usually. I would advise taking the case off from the bottom, where there is less to \"crack\".08-12 - They are supposed to be sending me a newer model of the case that fixes the problem, once I get it I will test it out and update my review.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Awesome case - has one very serious flaw", "unixReviewTime": 1277769600, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2010"}

I ordered this case back in October and I received it from the seller within a few days.  The price of this case is unbeatable especially given the quality of the product. The color is also amazing!  The actual color of the case is a brighter shade of pink than advertised.  It's more like hot pink than the dull shade of pink shown above. This case is also very sleek-looking.  It is neither thick nor bulky but very durable. I have dropped my phone and few times and the case has held up quite well--even when I'd accidentally dropped my phone on cement!

I only take it off to clean the phone using mostly compressed air to clean the inside of the case and the phone. I too found it difficult to take apart at first, but there is a trick to it. One is patients which I know a lot of us don't have. Put the phone upside down on a soft surface like your couch, bed or even your lap so it doesn't fly away as you apply pressure to open it. Pry into the bottom part by the speaker or mic. Use your fingernails to slowly pry it apart using light pressure. It will give way and open. If you don't have nails, use a credit card or similar item to get it started. I don't recommend a flathead screwdriver as this can damage the phone if it slips. The bottom is the strongest part of the case and should resolve the breaking of the top part by the volume control.

One feature I like is the plug lights up very well when plugged in, hence you're not looking for a microscopic green light to let you know the charger is fully plugged in.  The contact for the phone may be a bit large for some cases, but I've had no trouble with mine...which are the inexpensive ones.  While charging, it's a good idea to place your iPhone4 in a location where it won't be moved.  I've noticed that if I pick up the phone to talk or text (obviously not while driving) that the contact can come loose.  Simply pressing it back in place will solve the problem.  For me, that's minor but for others, it may be a deal killer...so just be aware.  On a final positive note, I've noticed this charger will charge my iPhone4 very quickly and that alone is worth the price.  When the battery is almost exhausted, it's back up to at least 25-30% in no time at all.

While it's not quite perfect, it's about as close as any case I've tried (and I've tried TONS).It's slim. One of the qualities of the iphone 4 I like is it's slim form factor. A lot of the cases out there add so much bulk that I may as well be carrying around a home phone with wall charger attached. This one keeps my iphone looking like an iphone in all respects. It has just enough of a lip around the front that it keeps the glass from contacting when you set/drop it on the floor, but it doesn't impede full use of the touchscreen. A lot of cases i've used/tried would take up a decent chunk of that slim border of glass on the side between the edge and the screen. It would not allow me to actually touch and use the edges of the iphone! this one clips to the metal band, not around the glass, so it's fully open :-)One of my favorite aspects: they have scalloped out the back end of the case where the volume and mute buttons are. It's one of those things that you realize after you've had a case like this that you know you couldn't go back to having it any other way. It's nice because when you're using the phone, you don't have to poke your fingers IN to where the buttons are, they're easily reachable and activated but sneaking your finger/thumb around from the back end, which is the end you come from to use the buttons anyhow. It's a nice touch.The one knock I have against it is that while it has what they call a \"velvet soft finish,\" I wish it was a bit grippier. It has SOME tac to it, but I'd like it to be just ever so slightly \"rubberier.\" I've only come across one other case that was closer to the grip I like which was the incase slider IN RED, even every other color of that case line is just as slick as this case, for some reason the RED incase slider has the most tac of any case I've felt.Anyhow, despite that one knock, it's otherwise the perfect case for me!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best snap case for iphone 4/4s", "unixReviewTime": 1337040000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2012"}

There is no need to be price gouged.These bumpers are, thanks to Apple's poor antenna engineering on the iPhone 4, a practical necessity to allow the phone function with decent reception (unless you want to hold the phone with the tips of your fingers). While I might be inclined to knock a star or two off my review of the iPhone 4, were Amazon to sell it, I have to grudgingly give the Bumpers five stars. They are minimal, yet highly effective. Moreover, they \"include\" their own metal buttons (which contact the actual phone buttons beneath) which really provides a much better experience than the usual cover, which either expects you to hit the button by getting your finger through some tiny hole, or push on the rubber case itself above the obscured phone button.

At first I liked my bumper quite a bit but then started to see it was pretty flawed. Apple should have made the entire bumper silicone instead of just the very edges. Instead you get a semi-hard plastic which is okay but provides an inferior grip situation versus had the bumper been made entirely of silicone. The bumper also exposes the entire back of the phone. Once you've used a case that covers the back I think you will prefer it versus an exposed-back case.My last point has to do with value/price. I got my bumper for free, so really I cannot complain. However Apple wants $29.99 for these bumpers, and honestly, that is a tragedy. I respect that Apple wants to make a profit here, however these bumpers most likely cost somewhere between $1 - $3 to create. To sell such a thing for $29.99 is laughable. I think $9.99 would have been a fair price for consumers, and at most, $14.99. If you can score an Apple bumper at that price (and be cool with an exposed back) then go for it.
